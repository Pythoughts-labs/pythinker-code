# Tasks

## Active

- [ ] Agent-harness adoption arc (`feat/agent-harness-enhancements`): executing
      `tasks/agent-harness-adoption-plan.md` (124 verified items, tiers 1-4).
      DONE: all 5 Tier-1 high/S + first high/M — `047a0b29` orchestration
      provider+scrub, `b40cdb71` ACP question-tool hide, `36cedafd` plan,
      `e722278c` restore-time history invariant repair, `388da2d3`
      decision-complete plan mode, `f5b9b06a` print channel discipline,
      `c8d82d38` review git-context+merge-base, `e2e74b70` parallel-tool
      concurrency policy, `1615cfbd` reactive overflow recovery (loop +
      SimpleCompaction halving; classify_api_error → soul/api_errors.py),
      `0f39a3b1` per-project trust gating of project hooks (project_trust.py
      store + /trust persistence + untrusted-TOML tolerance), `9d1178f4`
      unknown-config-key diagnostics (unknown_config_key_paths +
      PYTHINKER_STRICT_CONFIG).
      `bf549c28` model-switch carry-over (summarize_all with the outgoing
      model seeds the new session; model_switch_carryover flag).
      `5dc87aaf` known-safe command auto-approval (is_known_safe_command
      positive allowlist; root-only elision, deny-gate preserved).
      `5dc87aaf`+`59deceff` known-safe command elision (+env-prefix
      allowlist security fix; e2e approval pins moved to wrapper commands
      `5dadb1c6`), `05f86428`+`df4801f5` MCP startup timeout + actionable
      failure diagnostics (/mcp shows classified error lines).
      `60fc8b16` MCP per-server tool filtering (enabledTools/disabledTools,
      list-time + call-time).
      NEXT (Tier-1 high/M, plan order): MCP startup
      timeout+diagnostics; MCP per-server tool filtering; subagent context
      fork; workspace isolation for parallel writers; turn rollup analytics;
      feedback diagnostics; fuzzy edit ladder; permissions-state
      instructions; model escalation w/ justification; JSONL lifecycle
      stream; schema-constrained final output; /review command; hook trust
      gating; PostToolUse feedback to model; deferred tool loading; foreign
      schema sanitization. Discipline: TDD + clean-code-guard + make check
      per checkpoint; single writer now.
- [ ] Windows shell hardening (researched, not yet implemented): bash-first
      shell policy (Git Bash probe → pwsh → powershell, never cmd), Windows
      tool-description guidance (`;` not `&&` on PS 5.1, `$env:`, quoting),
      docker-daemon-down interceptor (`error during connect` +
      `pipe/docker` → actionable remediation incl. `docker desktop start`),
      POSIX-ism lint under PowerShell, `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` + `taskkill /T`
      tree-kill, `-EncodedCommand` UTF-16LE for PowerShell args. Full brief in
      session notes 2026-06-12; permission tokenization is POSIX-blind for
      PowerShell syntax (gate review needed before shipping).

Merged from `refactor/agent-contract-and-tool-metadata` — step 1 of
`tasks/design-adoption-blueprint.md` (agent-logic/coding-flow cleanup):

- [x] Task 1: FetchURL untrusted-envelope fix — DONE (ceeeeb78; 3 TDD tests,
      spec + quality review approved). Deferred: add `await
      builder.spill_to_disk()` at the trafilatura + fetch-service sites for
      event-loop hygiene (pre-existing asymmetry; no output difference).
      Original: `tools/web/fetch.py:232,277,338`
      write pre-rendered `UntrustedData(...).render_for_prompt()` into the
      builder, so truncation can cut the closing envelope tag and break
      `strip_untrusted_envelope` (endswith). Switch to raw write +
      `builder.mark_untrusted()` (idiom: `tools/web/search.py:174-177`).
      → verify: new TDD test reproducing tag truncation fails before / passes
      after; `tests/utils` untrusted-wrapping suite green.
- [x] Task 2: Public `turn()` contract on PythinkerSoul — DONE (7e96dfb8;
      thin delegate keeps `_turn` as the test patch point; 3 call sites
      migrated, suppressions removed; contract docstring distinguishes
      framed vs unframed callers; spec + quality review approved).
- [x] Task 3: Declarative tool metadata for the dispatch/permission gates —
      DONE (eaa96d6e; `external_side_effect_tool` ClassVar on the 3 adapters,
      `emits_tool_execution_started_after_approval` pinned on 8 classes,
      both string-match consumers rewritten; spec review, quality review,
      and security review (SAFE TO MERGE) all passed).

Review: branch `refactor/agent-contract-and-tool-metadata` (3 commits on top
of bff54f94) final-reviewed READY TO MERGE. Full `make test-pythinker-code`:
5279 passed, 1 failed — the failure is
`tests/e2e/test_shell_pty_e2e.py::test_shell_cancel_running_command_kills_process_and_recovers`,
verified PRE-EXISTING and machine-local: fails identically in isolation on
main (bff54f94) and on 7caeca33 / d51ef649 / 2904de00, all of which merged
with green CI. It is the ONLY test that sends ESC, so the local ESC-interrupt
PTY path has no corroborating coverage. Needs its own debugging session
(suspect ESC flush timing in the local macOS/Python 3.14 PTY environment).

Out of scope this PR (logged): pricing display move out of core, the
`extract_key_argument` name→spec registry, larger soul/toolset splits
(blueprint P1a/P2a/P2b).

### Deferred from this branch's reviews
- [x] FetchURL spill awaits — DONE: `await builder.spill_to_disk()` added at
  the trafilatura + fetch-service sites.
- [x] MCPTool event ordering — DONE: `emits_tool_execution_started_after_approval`
  set on MCPTool (Approval.request emits after resolution, idempotent per
  call id); pinned in test_toolset.py alongside the other 8 classes.
- No structural enforcement that FUTURE external adapters declare
  `external_side_effect_tool` (pin tests cover the current three only).
  Deliberately NOT bolted on now: the three adapters share no in-package
  base class to hang an `__init_subclass__` hook on; revisit when the
  toolset split (blueprint P2a) introduces an adapter base.

Done: `mythos-enhancements` PR #118 merged (d51ef649).

### Deferred (documented, not silently dropped)

- Read-only MCP doc-lookup carve-out for offline roles — today ALL MCP tools
  are fail-closed below the implement profile (deliberate); reviewer specs
  route doc needs to the parent/`scout` instead. Revisit only with a real
  allowlist mechanism design.
- Per-profile shell timeout caps: rejected — long `pythinker review`/`secscan`
  runs are legitimate; spec-level timeout discipline shipped instead.
- Codename polish: a background RunAgents child can show a name codename AND a
  different task-id codename (each distinctive, mildly redundant); aligning
  them needs a preferred-suffix param through `manager.launch_agent_task`.
- Narrow race: a subagent launched while the parent's background MCP connect is
  still in flight misses shared MCP tools (map populated later) — needs a
  re-bind or wait at subagent build.
- Test-design debt: test_learn_slash mocks soul._turn; test_soul_status_cost
  asserts an import — black-boxing them is its own task.
- From the review-safety plan: full ShellReadPolicy allowlist (would deny every
  unclassified command — needs maintainer call); ReviewCapabilityRegistry +
  scanner ladder (no external scanner subsystem exists yet); Phase 5
  heartbeats/token budgets (own PR); Phase 6 full TaskEventStore renderer
  rewrite (own PR); OS-level sandboxing (Seatbelt/Landlock).
- Non-interactive Rich Live path forces `live.update(refresh=True)` on every
  wire message in `_live_view.py`, bypassing its 10fps clock — separate
  flicker contributor in that mode.
- Provider compat: 400 "enable_thinking restricted to True" lives in
  pythinker_core openai_legacy (external); Bugsink keeps reporting it (4xx
  stays unexpected) until fixed upstream — desired.
- Infra: edge OTLP collector accepts any bearer token; SigNoz SMTP may need
  configuring for alert email delivery.
