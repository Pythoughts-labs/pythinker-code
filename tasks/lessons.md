# Lessons

Repo-specific rules accumulated from corrections and post-session reviews.
Format: trigger → rule.

## Subagent orchestration

- **When dispatching subagents whose results you will immediately synthesize**
  (review + report, parallel analysis with no interleaved work), use
  **foreground fan-out** (`RunAgents` foreground mode) — results return inline,
  no polling or notification parsing. Reserve background mode for when the
  orchestrator has other work to do while children run.
- **When a non-blocking `TaskOutput` returns `retrieval_status: not_ready`**,
  do not snapshot-poll again. Either call `TaskOutput` with `block=true` and a
  realistic timeout, or continue other work until the completion notification
  arrives. Repeated non-blocking polls waste turns and tokens.
- **When deciding whether a background task is done**, trust only
  `status`/`retrieval_status` from a tool result. Notifications are a wake
  signal, not a state assertion — never claim "both agents completed" from a
  glimpsed notification.
- **When tempted to read a subagent's live output file mid-run**, don't. The
  `tasks/agent-*.md` log is only authoritative after the task is terminal;
  reading it early yields truncated content and wasted reasoning. Completion
  notifications now carry `output_path` + `output_size_bytes` — read the file
  after `terminal_reason: completed`.

## Review scoping

- **When asked to review/scan "the branch" and `git status` shows a dirty
  tree**, scope the diff as committed work PLUS the working tree
  (`git diff main` against the worktree, or `main...HEAD` + `git diff HEAD`),
  or explicitly state that uncommitted changes are excluded. `git diff
  main...HEAD` alone silently skips the newest code.
- **When writing a report to a path that already exists**, check it first —
  date-stamp the filename or append a run section instead of silently
  overwriting prior results.

## Bookkeeping honesty

- **Never narrate a bookkeeping action** ("let me update the todo list",
  "saving a note") without the corresponding tool call in the same turn.
  Narrated intentions that never execute are phantom state.

## Shell hygiene

- **When running repo commands**, the working directory persists between Bash
  calls — don't prefix every command with `cd <repo>`. Batch related read-only
  recon (e.g. `git log` + `git diff --stat`) into one call.

## Review orchestration

- **When running review/security subagents**, use the project-scoped agents in
  `.claude/agents/` (global `~/.claude/agents/security-reviewer.md` and
  `planner.md` describe the *other* Pythinker project — FastAPI/Vue/Mongo —
  and produce phantom attack-surface analysis here).
- **When waiting on background agents**, make exactly one blocking
  `TaskOutput(block=true, timeout=600s)` call per agent — never interleave
  non-blocking polls or read prior sessions' task logs.
- **When deep-scanning**, run `/deep-scan`: pin the base SHA via
  `git merge-base`, launch both reviewers in one parallel block, verify every
  High/Medium finding against the real code before reporting, and write the
  report to a dated, sha-suffixed file (never overwrite).

## Dependency & docs research

- **When checking library versions**, registries (PyPI JSON API / `npm view`)
  are the only source of truth; docs MCPs are for migration notes and API
  usage only, after the delta is established. Verify "feature X added in
  version Y" claims against release notes before asserting them.
- **When recommending an upgrade**, first grep direct imports with
  `--include="*.py"` (excluding `blackbox/` and `__pycache__`) — a dep with
  zero direct imports gets no API-migration advice — and read pin-reason
  comments / git blame before calling a pin an "upgrade opportunity".
- **Never claim an artifact was persisted** ("report saved", "todo updated")
  without having made the Write call. Promise → tool call → claim, in that
  order. Use `/dep-audit` for dependency reports.

## Layer discipline

- **When asked to "enhance the agent" in this repo**, the target is the
  pythinker product itself: `src/pythinker_code/` (prompts, agents/default/*,
  soul/slash.py, tool hints) and `.pythinker/prompts/` for custom commands —
  NOT `.claude/` config. Transcripts showing `~/.pythinker/sessions/` paths
  are pythinker runs; behavioral fixes belong in the product.

## Verification gates

- **When running a gate command (make check, pytest, ruff) through a pipe or
  in the background**, the pipeline exit code is the LAST command's (e.g.
  `tail`), and background notifications report that masked code. Never claim
  a gate passed from a notification summary — read the gate's own output for
  its verdict line, or run it unpiped with `; echo "EXIT=$?"`.
