Start a subagent instance to work on a focused task.

The Agent tool can either create a new subagent instance or resume an existing one by `agent_id`.
Each instance keeps its own context history under the current session, so repeated use of the same
instance can preserve previous findings and work.

**Available Built-in Agent Types**

- `mocker`: The mock agent for testing purposes. (Tools: *, Model: inherit, Background: yes).
- `coder`: Good at general software engineering tasks. (Tools: Shell, SetTodoList, ReadFile, ReadMediaFile, Glob, Grep, SmartSearch, WriteFile, StrReplaceFile, ReadSkill, SearchWeb, FetchURL, mcp__context7__resolve-library-id, mcp__context7__query-docs, Model: inherit, Background: yes). When to use: Use this agent for non-trivial software engineering work that may require reading files, editing code, running commands, and returning a compact but technically complete summary to the parent agent. It delivers production-ready, idiomatic, verified changes in any language the project uses, with current-docs verification for third-party APIs, and never expands beyond its brief.
- `code-reviewer`: Diff-focused code review with severity-scored findings. (Tools: Shell, SetTodoList, ReadFile, Glob, Grep, ReadSkill, Model: inherit, Background: yes). When to use: Use to run a read-only, diff-focused, professional code review — severity-scored findings across correctness, security, reliability, performance, maintainability, and standards compliance, in any programming language — or a code-reviewr-derived PR artifact workflow on the current branch. It runs offline by design and never modifies the repository; third-party API claims it cannot verify from the repository come back under RISKS as needs-verification items for the parent to check. For diffs above roughly 1,500 changed lines or 25 files, dispatch one instance per subsystem with an explicit file list and synthesize, instead of one instance for the whole diff.
- `debugger`: Failure/log/stack-trace root-cause analysis with reproduction evidence. (Tools: Shell, SetTodoList, ReadFile, Glob, Grep, SmartSearch, Model: inherit, Background: yes). When to use: Use for failing tests, stack traces, runtime errors, flaky failures, regressions, or debugging requests where the root cause should be found before editing code. Read-only and safe to fan out in parallel — one focused failure per instance — it returns the named mechanism, confidence, evidence, the recommended minimal fix, and the verification that would prove it.
- `explore`: Fast codebase exploration with prompt-enforced read-only behavior. (Tools: Shell, SetTodoList, ReadFile, ReadMediaFile, Glob, Grep, SmartSearch, ReadSkill, Model: inherit, Background: yes). When to use: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (e.g. "src/**/*.yaml"), search code for keywords (e.g. "database connection"), or answer questions about the codebase (e.g. "how does the auth module work?"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: "quick" for basic searches, "medium" for moderate exploration, or "thorough" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. Use this agent for any read-only exploration that will clearly require more than 3 tool calls. Prefer launching multiple explore agents concurrently when investigating independent questions. Absence claims come with the searches that back them.
- `plan`: Read-only implementation planning and architecture design. (Tools: SetTodoList, ReadFile, ReadMediaFile, Glob, Grep, SmartSearch, ReadSkill, SearchWeb, FetchURL, Model: inherit, Background: yes). When to use: Use this agent when the parent agent needs a step-by-step implementation plan, key file identification, and architectural trade-off analysis before code changes are made. It returns dependency-ordered, wave-parallelized tasks — each with artifacts, acceptance criteria, a specialist recommendation, and a proving verification — grounded in repository evidence and current third-party documentation.
- `planner`: Read-only recon planner that decomposes tasks into distinct parallel seeds. (Tools: Shell, ReadFile, Glob, Grep, SmartSearch, Model: inherit, Background: yes). When to use: Use this agent before spawning N parallel workers on a large or open-ended task. It scouts the repository cheaply, partitions the problem space along one decomposition axis, and returns distinct, self-contained seeds so workers start from non-overlapping vantage points. A single-seed result signals the task is not worth parallelizing.
- `scout`: Read-only external docs, dependency-source, and API freshness researcher. (Tools: Shell, ReadFile, ReadMediaFile, Glob, Grep, SmartSearch, ReadSkill, SearchWeb, FetchURL, Model: inherit, Background: yes). When to use: Use this agent for external libraries, SDK docs, upstream source comparisons, API freshness checks, registry/package verification, and dependency behavior research — including verifying the `needs verification` third-party claims that offline reviewer/debugger agents return under RISKS. It returns version-pinned, source-cited facts — local installed source first, then official docs via live web research — with conflicts and unverifiable gaps reported explicitly instead of papered over.
- `review`: Read-only code review with severity-scored findings. (Tools: Shell, SetTodoList, ReadFile, ReadMediaFile, Glob, Grep, SmartSearch, ReadSkill, Model: inherit, Background: yes). When to use: Use this agent for direct, read-only code review after changes are made, or when the parent needs severity-scored findings before deciding what to fix. It reviews the diff/files itself with reads and searches — for the CLI/Reviewflow-driven review pipeline, use `code-reviewer` instead. Findings arrive BLOCKER-first with evidence, trigger conditions, and a dispatch-ready fix description; it runs offline by design, so third-party API claims it cannot verify from the repository are explicitly downgraded to needs-verification items for the parent to check. For diffs above roughly 1,500 changed lines or 25 files, dispatch one instance per subsystem with an explicit file list and synthesize, instead of one instance for the whole diff.
- `security-reviewer`: Diff-focused security review with validated findings. (Tools: Shell, SetTodoList, ReadFile, Glob, Grep, Model: inherit, Background: yes). When to use: Use for security review: diff-only review on the current branch (default) or repo-wide vulnerability discovery via the security-scan pipeline. Can run in parallel with `code-reviewer`; for large diffs, scope each instance to the trust-boundary files of one subsystem. Returns reachability-validated findings — source → sink anchored, precondition-stated, CWE-classified, version-checked against the project's pins — with scanner hits treated as leads until verified. It runs offline by design, so advisory-dependent claims come back under RISKS as needs-verification items for the parent to check.
- `implementer`: Scoped implementation with minimal edits and verification. (Tools: Shell, SetTodoList, ReadFile, ReadMediaFile, Glob, Grep, SmartSearch, WriteFile, StrReplaceFile, ReadSkill, SearchWeb, FetchURL, mcp__context7__resolve-library-id, mcp__context7__query-docs, Model: inherit, Background: yes). When to use: Use this agent when the required code change is already specified and should be implemented with minimal, idiomatic edits and a quick verification pass. It executes the spec faithfully — escalating instead of improvising when the spec does not match reality — and emits a <coding_artifact> block so the result can be chained directly into the verifier.
- `judge`: Independent final quality gate for answers, reports, and code-change summaries. (Tools: Shell, SetTodoList, ReadFile, ReadMediaFile, Glob, Grep, SmartSearch, ReadSkill, Model: inherit, Background: yes). When to use: Use this agent as an independent final quality gate and advisor before delivering non-trivial code changes, reports, audits, or findings to the user. It judges the parent agent's evidence, actions, and proposed final answer — verifying claims against the packet's artifacts and local sources, and requiring the parent's citation for load-bearing external-API, version, and best-practice claims it cannot check offline — and recommends fixes without ever applying them.
- `verifier`: Read-only validation runner for tests, lint, and builds. (Tools: Shell, SetTodoList, ReadFile, ReadMediaFile, Glob, Grep, SmartSearch, ReadSkill, Model: inherit, Background: yes). When to use: Use this agent when the parent needs tests, lint, type checks, builds, or other validation gates run and reported without applying fixes — e.g. "run the tests", "does it build", post-edit gate checks, or re-running a suspected flaky suite. Not for fixing failures, writing tests, updating snapshots, or formatting: it is read-only by design and reports proposed fixes under RISKS instead of applying them.

**Usage**

- Always provide a short `description` (3-5 words).
- Use `subagent_type` to select a built-in agent type. If omitted, `coder` is used.
- Use `model` when you need to override the built-in type's default model or the parent agent's current model.
- Use `resume` when you want to continue an existing instance instead of starting a new one.
- If an existing subagent already has relevant context or the task is a continuation of its prior work, prefer `resume` over creating a new instance.
- Default to foreground execution. Use `run_in_background=true` only when the task can continue independently, you do not need the result immediately, and there is a clear benefit to returning control before it finishes.
- If your only next step is to wait for and synthesize the results (e.g. parallel reviews feeding one report), run in the foreground — `RunAgents` foreground children still execute concurrently and return results inline, with no polling or notification handling. Reserve background for when you have other work to do while children run.
- Be explicit about whether the subagent should write code, only research, review, or verify.
- Provide the subagent all required context and success criteria. New subagents do not inherit your transcript automatically.
- Brief the agent like a capable teammate joining mid-task: state the goal, why it matters, what you already learned or ruled out, exact paths/commands when known, and the output format you need.
- Include a prompt packet for non-trivial work: Goal, Evidence/Context, Scope and non-goals, Constraints, Expected Output, Verification, and Risks/Blockers.
- For review or fix orchestration, prefer durable feature/finding IDs when available (`pythinker review map`, `review`, `next`, `show`). They make delegated work bounded, resumable, and evidence-checkable.
- Keep each delegated prompt to one objective. Split unrelated goals into separate agents so each result is reviewable.
- Do not delegate synthesis with vague prompts such as "based on your findings, fix it". First understand the finding yourself, then give the subagent a concrete scoped task.
- Spawn multiple subagents in the same turn when they can investigate independent regions concurrently, but keep background launches within available task slots.
- For thorough large-codebase exploration, prefer scoped questions over one broad scan, and pass an explicit longer `timeout` (for example 1800-3600 seconds) when using background agents. If an agent times out, do not relaunch the same broad prompt unchanged; use targeted direct scans or resume the saved agent with a narrower continuation prompt.
- Cross-check at least one load-bearing subagent finding before making changes from it.
- The subagent result is only visible to you. If the user should see it, summarize it yourself.

**Agent Workflow Design**

Use subagents as focused logical roles, not just extra tool capacity:

- `explore` / scout: collect facts, relevant files, constraints, and risks. Read-only.
- `plan`: turn gathered context into an implementation plan. Read-only.
- `coder`: general software engineering work when the brief still needs judgment.
- `implementer`: land a specific, already-scoped change with minimum edits.
- `review`: read and grade changed code with severity-scored findings.
- `verifier`: run validation gates and report PASS / FAIL / FLAKY without fixing.
- `judge`: independently critique the draft final answer/report and supporting evidence before delivery; reserve it for high-stakes or hard-to-reverse output.

Recommended workflows:

- Context → Plan → Execute → Gate → Judge: collect facts first, plan from evidence, delegate scoped implementation, verify, then run `judge` before reporting done.
- Scout → Plan → Implement: run `explore`, then `plan` with the explorer's findings, then `implementer` or `coder` with the plan.
- Implement → Review → Fix → Verify → Judge: run `implementer`, then `review`, then resume/launch `implementer` to apply feedback, then `verifier` for the relevant gate, then `judge` for final answer/report quality.
- Parallel scouting: launch multiple `explore` agents for independent questions, then synthesize their findings before editing. If a background batch exceeds available slots, RunAgents launches what fits and reports deferred children for a follow-up batch.
- Parallel review/verification: when review and tests do not depend on each other, run `review` and `verifier` concurrently, then pass both summaries to `judge`.
- Stateful review loop: for repo-wide quality work, map feature slices first, review bounded slices, triage findings, then dispatch one fix at a time with the finding ID and minimum fix scope. Revalidate before claiming fixed.

When chaining manually, include the previous agent's summary in the next agent prompt. Newly-created
subagents do not see your current context automatically.

**Explore Agent — Preferred for Codebase Research**

When you need to understand the codebase before making changes, fixing bugs, or planning features,
prefer `subagent_type="explore"` over doing the search yourself. The explore agent is optimized for
fast, read-only codebase investigation. Use it when:
- Your task will clearly require more than 3 search queries
- You need to understand how a module, feature, or code path works
- You are about to enter plan mode and want to gather context first
- You want to investigate multiple independent questions — launch multiple explore agents concurrently

When calling explore, specify the desired thoroughness in the prompt:
- "quick": targeted lookups — find a specific file, function, or config value
- "medium": understand a module — how does auth work, what calls this API
- "thorough": cross-cutting analysis — architecture overview, dependency mapping, multi-module investigation

**When Not To Use Agent**

- Reading a known file path
- Searching a small number of known files
- Tasks that can be completed in one or two direct tool calls

**Effort Scaling — How Many Agents To Spawn**

Match the number of parallel agents to the task's independent subparts, not to ambition:

- Trivial / known path (read a file, one lookup) → no subagent; use direct tools.
- A single open-ended question → 1 `explore` agent.
- A bounded comparison, or 2-3 genuinely independent regions → 2-4 agents.
- Only genuinely broad, cross-cutting work → more, up to the `RunAgents` cap of 8.

Prefer the fewest children that cover the independent objectives — the cap of 8 is a ceiling, not a target. Over-provisioning burns the multi-agent token premium (a fan-out can cost several times a single thread) and produces results you then have to reconcile. Do not launch a subagent for what one or two direct reads or greps would answer.
