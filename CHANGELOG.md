# Changelog

All notable changes to `pythinker-code` are tracked in this file.

Pythinker Code uses a `0.MINOR.PATCH` version scheme. `MINOR` is a release
counter that continues advancing with each release. `PATCH` is reserved for
hotfixes against an already-released `MINOR`. There is no `1.0.0` milestone
planned on this line.

Releases earlier than `0.8.0` were published as `pythinker-code` 1.x/2.x
under a different scheme. The full pre-`0.8.0` history is preserved in
[`docs/history/CHANGELOG-pre-0.8.0.md`](docs/history/CHANGELOG-pre-0.8.0.md).
All 1.x and 2.x releases have been yanked from PyPI and removed from the
GitHub Releases page; `0.8.0` is the new starting line.

## Unreleased

- **Agent-loop wire events.** Added `TodoListUpdated`, `SubagentToolFallback`, `AgentListDelta`, `ToolUseSkipped`, and `ContextOverflowRecovered` wire events for orchestration observability.
- **Toolset dedup visibility.** Cross-step duplicate tool calls can emit `ToolUseSkipped` when a tool opts in via `emits_tool_use_skipped`.
- **Todo wire event.** `SetTodoList` emits `TodoListUpdated` on write/read.
- **Agent-list dynamic injection.** Root sessions receive a cache-stable agent-list injection via `AgentListInjectionProvider`.
- **Subagent fallback wire event.** Unknown subagent types emit `SubagentToolFallback`.
- **Reactive overflow recovery event.** Context-overflow compact retries emit `ContextOverflowRecovered` (one-shot per turn).
- **Token-budget nudge.** When `loop_control.max_session_cost_usd` is set and goal auto-continue is off, the soul appends a one-shot spend reminder after a turn crosses `loop_control.budget_nudge_ratio`.
- **Agent tool description.** Added a brief prompt-hygiene note for spawning fresh agents.
- **Deliberate non-port.** Blackbox per-batch Haiku tool-use summary is not ported; the shell already renders tool progress via display blocks and wire events.

## 0.45.0 (2026-06-14)

- **Agent-tracing dashboard.** Added `pythinker dashboard` — a local web UI for inspecting sessions, wire events, context messages, tool statistics, and usage over time. It is also reachable from the interactive shell via the `/reports` slash command (aliased `/dashboard`).
- **Gemini finish_reason is now sticky once truncation is detected.** A second candidate with any non-`MAX_TOKENS` finish reason no longer overwrites a previously captured `"length"` signal at either the streaming or non-streaming path in the Google GenAI provider.
- **Budget-exhausted and stuck-loop messages are now visible in the shell.** Both handoff messages were appended to context but never sent to the wire, so the interactive shell showed no feedback when a spend ceiling or stuck-loop exit fired. Both now emit a `TextPart` wire event so the message appears in the shell.
- **Dark-theme prompt_toolkit border colors now match the TUI token constants.** Six stale slate hex values in `_PROMPT_STYLE_DARK` diverged from the current `border` and `border_muted` token values; they are now in sync and a parity test binds them going forward.
- **Non-review successful agents now show a summary preview in the agent tree.** Completed subagents with a `summary_preview` now display a dim preview line in the RunAgents tree renderer (review runs continue to use the findings table instead).
- **Non-string values in `required_mcp_servers` YAML are silently dropped.** Integers, booleans, and `null` entries were previously coerced to strings (`"1"`, `"False"`, `"None"`), creating permanently unsatisfiable MCP server names. Only actual string entries are now retained.
- **Fixed MiniMax token-plan `/usage` accuracy.** The token-plan response now meters by
  percentage (the count fields are 0) and reports reset times in milliseconds; the adapter was
  reading the zero counts (showing "0 requests used") and treating milliseconds as seconds
  (showing resets like "171d" for a 5-hour window). It now reads `*_remaining_percent` and
  converts reset times correctly, so e.g. a week at 82% remaining shows "18% used" resetting in
  hours, not days.
- **GLM-5.2 (1M context) is now the default Z.AI model.** Logging in with Z.AI selects
  `z-ai/glm-5.2` with its full 1,000,000-token context window. GLM-5.2 is absent from z.ai's
  model-listing API, so it is pinned into the catalog and offered even when discovery omits it;
  if z.ai later lists it, the API definition wins and it is shown once (no duplicate). Earlier
  GLM models (5.1, 5, 5-turbo, 4.7, 4.5-air) remain available.
- **Kimi K2.7 Code added, and a new Kimi Coding Plan provider.** `kimi-k2.7-code` is now the
  default model on the Moonshot plan, and a separate "Kimi Coding Plan" provider
  (`/login kimi`) targets Moonshot's Anthropic-compatible coding endpoint with `kimi-k2.7-code`.
- **Verb spinner stays visible while a foreground tool or subagent runs.** The shimmering
  "Working…/Thinking…" activity indicator now persists for the whole active turn — including
  while a foreground tool (such as a shell-started server) or a subagent is executing — instead
  of disappearing until the tool finished. This keeps long tool/subagent waits feeling alive
  rather than frozen. An in-progress todo still swaps the verb for the todo title as before.
- **Project instructions delivered as a separate authoritative message.** The merged
  `AGENTS.md` is no longer baked into the system prompt; it is delivered as a session-start,
  user-role `<system-reminder>` preamble, assembled fresh on every request from session
  state. This keeps the project rules immune to two regressions a system-prompt move would
  otherwise risk — context compaction can no longer summarize them away (they never enter the
  persisted history) and the dynamic-injection token budget can no longer truncate them —
  while keeping the system prompt free of per-project content. `pythinker system-prompt` shows
  the reminder below a labeled divider so the dump stays faithful.
- **Inspect the assembled system prompt.** New `pythinker system-prompt` command
  renders and prints the fully-assembled system prompt for an agent
  (`--agent <name>`, `--agent-file <path>`, `--work-dir <dir>`) — substituting the
  live work directory, OS/shell, merged `AGENTS.md`, and discovered skills. It is
  read-only: no session is created, no provider auth is required, and no MCP
  servers are loaded.
- **Bound parallel tool fan-out.** Parallel-safe tool calls in one turn still
  overlap, but now up to a fixed concurrency cap (10) instead of without bound, so
  a turn that fans out many readers (e.g. dozens of web fetches) can no longer open
  an unbounded number of sockets/file handles at once. Mutating-tool ordering and
  writer exclusivity are unchanged.
- **Optional per-session spend ceiling.** New `loop_control.max_session_cost_usd`
  config option (off by default). When set, a turn stops with a clear
  budget-exhausted handoff message once the session's accumulated estimated cost
  reaches the ceiling, instead of running to the step limit — and goal
  auto-continuations and agent flows halt too. Best-effort: cost is `0` for models
  with unknown pricing, so the ceiling never blocks when spend cannot be estimated.
- **Sensitive host files always re-confirm.** Writes to shell startup files
  (`.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`, …), `.git` internals/hooks, the custom `.githooks`
  hooks directory, `.ssh`, `.vscode`, and git
  credentials (`.gitconfig`, `.netrc`, `.git-credentials`) are now classified as a
  distinct edit action that re-confirms every time — even under yolo/auto — and is
  never recorded as session-approved, exactly like edits to pythinker's own config.
  This closes an auto-approve gap where a `.git/hooks` write inside the workspace was
  treated as an ordinary edit.
- **Accept-edits mode.** New `/accept-edits` toggle auto-approves reversible
  in-workspace ordinary file edits while still prompting for shell, destructive,
  outside-workspace, config-surface, and sensitive host-file edits. It is
  session-local (not persisted) and suppressed by safe mode. Pairs with the deny-set
  above so a `.git/hooks` or shell-rc write is never swept into the auto-approve tier.
- **Agents can declare required MCP servers.** A markdown agent's frontmatter may set
  `required_mcp_servers: [..]`; spawning that agent (via `Agent` or `RunAgents`) is
  rejected with a clear message when those servers are configured-and-absent, instead of
  wasting a turn on an agent that cannot reach its tools. While MCP is still loading the
  spawn is allowed (the servers may yet connect).
- **UserPromptSubmit hooks can add context.** A non-blocking `UserPromptSubmit` hook's
  `additionalContext` is now injected into the user turn as a system reminder, so the
  model sees it as context for the prompt (previously only a hook *block* was honored).
  Slash-command parsing still reads only the user's text, never the appended context.
- **Stale-overwrite guard for file edits.** If you read a file and it then changes on
  disk (edited by you in another window or by another tool), overwriting it with WriteFile
  or editing it with StrReplaceFile is now rejected with "File has been modified since you
  last read it" so external changes are not silently clobbered — read it again first. This
  catches external edits that StrReplaceFile's exact-string matching alone would miss.
  First-contact writes (a file you never read) are unaffected, and a tool's own write
  refreshes the read-state so consecutive edits are never falsely flagged.
- **Recover from output-token truncation.** When a response is cut off by the
  output-token limit and makes no tool call, the turn no longer ends with a half-finished
  answer treated as complete — the model is nudged to continue from where it stopped, up
  to `loop_control.max_truncation_recoveries` times per turn (default 3; `0` disables).
  pythinker-core now surfaces the provider's truncation signal so the loop can detect it.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.45.0`, or use the native installer for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Pythoughts-labs/pythinker-code/releases/latest).

## 0.44.0 (2026-06-13)

- **Toggle auto-update from the CLI.** Running `/update` now opens a menu — *Check for updates now* (the default, so a bare `/update` + Enter still checks immediately) or *Auto-update on startup* with its current state — so the toggle is discoverable without knowing a subcommand. `/update auto on|off` still sets it directly, and `/update auto` with no value opens an interactive On/Off picker (cursor defaulted to the current setting). The same toggle appears in the interactive `/settings` panel, and `pythinker info` reports the auto-update status. All surfaces show the *effective* state — an external override (`PYTHINKER_CLI_NO_AUTO_UPDATE` or a source checkout) is surfaced as the reason, renders the `/settings` row read-only, and makes `/update auto` report the read-only state rather than popping a no-op picker, so the toggle is never a silent no-op.
- **Windows in-app update no longer shows a spurious "could not close the program" error.** The native installer now waits for the launching `pythinker.exe` to fully exit (its PID is passed via `/PID`) before its Restart Manager scan runs, so the scan no longer races the launcher's teardown into a false "close the program and retry" dialog. The update already succeeded in that case; now it completes cleanly without the alarming prompt.
- **Simplified the Windows pip/uv/pipx update path.** Now that every shipped Windows install updates through the native installer, the Windows-only detached-spawn upgrade helper is removed; the remaining pip/uv/pipx path (a Windows source checkout, or any macOS/Linux install) runs the upgrade inline like POSIX, surfacing real command output and errors instead of a fire-and-forget process.

## 0.43.0 (2026-06-13)

- **Silent startup auto-updates (default on).** Managed and native installs now check for and apply updates in the background at startup, surfacing a restart-to-apply notice instead of a blocking prompt. Opt out with `auto_update = false` in config or `PYTHINKER_AUTO_UPDATE=0` in the environment. The Windows update path that replaces the running binary no longer escapes as an uncaught `SystemExit` and crashes the shell.
- **Tracing dashboard redesign.** The visualization dashboard (`pythinker vis`, the `/reports` UI) gets a soft-enterprise analytics refresh: redesigned Statistics and Sessions surfaces, a new Usage page with a usage heatmap and metric cards, and a consistent blue-accent treatment across the app.
- **Robust project-memory tooling.** Per-store budget accounting is now delimiter-aware, so a capacity rejection reports the exact free space instead of silently miscounting; the `Memory` tool gains a read-only `list` action for mid-session introspection; `/memory` shows per-store capacity with a "nearly full" panel at ≥85%; and writes that look like a rule, a value/limit, or that name a project file are gated behind a confirmation (honoring yolo/auto and "allow for session") that steers corrections toward the authoritative file instead of letting them silently accumulate in memory. Headless runs skip the gated write cleanly rather than erroring, and the routing-flagged debug log no longer records the raw content preview.
- **designer-skill MCP bridge.** Bundled a `designer-skill` stub skill that routes frontend work to the connected designer-skill MCP tools instead of failing ReadSkill; plugin-style names like `designer-skill:designer-skill` resolve correctly, and ReadSkill falls back to a generic MCP bridge (any user-configured server name) when only the MCP server is connected.
- **Always-on best practices.** New `best_practices_always` config option folds the full `/best-practices` engineering guidance into the root session's system prompt at startup, so the guardrails apply to every new session without running the command. Default off.
- **Agent guardrails.** The default system prompt now requires absence claims ("no em-dashes", "no leftover debug", "matches the source") to be backed by an actual zero-hit scan, and to re-ask rather than act on a self-authored reading of a non-responsive clarifying answer.
- **Smarter multi-edit errors.** A `StrReplaceFile` batch that fails schema validation (e.g. edit entries collapsed by a streaming glitch) now returns a precise, actionable error naming the bad entries and steering toward single-edit calls, instead of a wall of validation errors. Valid edits are never partially applied.
- **`/recap on|off`.** Toggle turn recaps from the recap command (mirrors `/settings recap(s)`), with a grey inline autosuggest reflecting the current state. Recaps also strip `<system-reminder>` blocks so injected harness context no longer leaks into one-line recaps.
- **Cleaner slash command menu.** The slash command popup now has a blank line separating it from the input row, drops the repetitive `[command]`/`[shell]` tag (keeping the distinguishing `[skill]`/`[flow]` ones), and gains a persistent footer (`Enter to select · ↑/↓ to navigate · Esc to cancel`) set off by its own separator line. When the list scrolls, the footer folds in a `+N more` count instead of silently hiding entries, and the menu height adapts to the terminal.
- **Login selector polish.** Configured `/login` providers render with distinct success/state styling; the background working indicator uses the braille spinner, and working tips wrap with a hanging indent under the verb.
- **Readable diff context.** Unchanged context lines in file-edit diff snippets now render in the normal body-text color instead of muted grey, so edited-file previews are easier to read; added/removed lines are unchanged.
- **Scratch cleanup on exit.** Sessions that end via an exception now clean up their scratch files instead of orphaning them.
- **Error telemetry is emitted at ERROR severity.** `error`/`crash`/`api_error` events were forwarded to OpenTelemetry logs at INFO, so severity filters and the error saved-views never matched them; they now map to ERROR (`session_load_failed` to WARN) with canonical `error.*` attributes, and a startup crash before the telemetry sink attaches is still flushed. Opt-out telemetry behavior is unchanged.

## 0.42.0 (2026-06-12)

- **Adversarial branch review hardening.** A multi-agent review pass confirmed and fixed: committed-but-clean isolation worktrees are now retained (commits ahead of the creation base count as changes — they were previously orphaned on cleanup); foreground shell commands and relative-path file edits now resolve against the agent's work dir, so worktree isolation actually binds them (host exec gained a `cwd` argument); safe mode now also disables the read-only-command prompt elision; locally parallel-safe MCP/tools run in parallel in the same-step gate; worktree add/remove serializes per repo. Behavior notes: same-step tool calls without `supports_parallel` now serialize deterministically (previously fully concurrent), and text-mode error diagnostics moved to stderr — capture `2>&1` or use `--output-format stream-json` if you scraped stdout.
- **The agent now knows its own permission posture.** A live permissions-state reminder renders the enforced profile, safe-mode/yolo/auto flags, mutation/network allowances, session-approved actions, and the shell gate's command-shaping rules — re-emitted exactly when the posture changes (/yolo, /auto, /trust, new approvals) instead of the model discovering policy through denied tool calls.
- **Edits recover from whitespace and smart-punctuation drift.** StrReplaceFile no longer hard-fails with "old string not found" when the only mismatch is trailing whitespace, indentation, or smart quotes/dashes: a graduated line-window ladder relocates the edit, replaces the actual file slice (preserving CRLF endings), and names the relaxation it used in the tool message. Multiple fuzzy hits without replace_all still error, so ambiguity is never silently resolved.
- **`isolation="worktree"` is now enforced for background write agents.** Previously it only recorded intent, so parallel coders shared one working tree and could clobber each other. A write-profile child now runs in its own git worktree of HEAD; its final report names the worktree path with a diff summary so changes merge deliberately, clean worktrees are removed, non-git roots fail with an actionable error, and read-profile children ignore the request.
- **MCP servers can be scoped to specific tools.** Optional `enabledTools` (exclusive allowlist) and `disabledTools` (denylist, wins on conflict) arrays per server in `mcp.json` keep a noisy server from flooding the model's tool list — filtered tools are never registered, and a call-time re-check guards shared tool maps.
- **A hung MCP server can no longer stall the whole session.** Server connects are bounded by a new `mcp.client.startup_timeout_ms` (default 30s) — previously a hung connect blocked every agent turn. `/mcp` now shows one actionable line per failed server (timeout → the config knob, 401 → the exact auth command, missing binary → the command path) instead of a bare "failed".
- **Provably read-only commands no longer prompt for approval.** The first `ls` or `git status` of a session used to interrupt with an approval dialog. A tight positive allowlist (read-only binaries and git subcommands, with hidden-command, write-redirection, wrapper, and fake-path rejections, fail closed) now elides the prompt in the root agent; subagents keep requesting approval as their unattended defense surface, and deny-profile decisions are never overridden.
- **Switching models keeps your conversation.** `/model` used to start a fresh session, discarding all context. The switch now seeds the new session with a plain-text summary written by the outgoing model (so provider-specific message formats never cross the boundary), falling back to the old fresh start if summarization fails; disable with `model_switch_carryover = false`.
- **Typo'd config keys are no longer silently ignored.** Loading now diffs the merged config against the model schema and warns with the dotted path and originating scope file for every unrecognized key (`default_yolo_typo = true` names itself and its file instead of silently changing nothing); `PYTHINKER_STRICT_CONFIG=1` escalates the findings to a startup error for CI.
- **Project-scope hooks now require trusting the project.** A cloned repository's `.pythinker/config.toml` could previously auto-execute its shell hooks at session start. Hooks from project and local scopes now load only after `/trust` records a durable per-project decision (stored user-side in `trusted_projects.json`, keyed by the resolved repo root); until then they are stripped with a warning naming the fix. Broken TOML in an untrusted project no longer blocks startup — the scope is treated as empty with a warning, while trusted projects keep the loud error.
- **Agent orchestration guidance is sharper for substantial tasks.** The default prompt now sharpens work-shaping guidance, and a new root-only runtime reminder nudges substantial normal-mode tasks toward the lightest effective path — direct tools, `SetTodoList`, foreground `RunAgents`, or verification — while backing off for plan mode, `/goal`, auto mode, and subagents.
- **The in-app updater recovers from Homebrew's untrusted-tap refusal.** Homebrew 5.0 (`HOMEBREW_REQUIRE_TAP_TRUST`) refuses to load formulas from third-party taps until `brew trust <tap>` is run once, which made the in-app `brew upgrade` fail with only a generic "run manually" hint. The updater now detects both the hard `Refusing to load … from untrusted tap` refusal and the soft `Skipping … not trusted` warning, offers to run `brew trust pythoughts-labs/pythinker` and retry the upgrade once on an interactive terminal, and otherwise prints the exact remediation. It also catches the silent no-op where an untrusted tap is skipped during `brew update` and `brew upgrade` exits 0 without advancing the version.
- **Session exports redact secrets surfaced by tool output.** A tool result (e.g. `grep`/`cat` over a `.env`) could write a secret value into an exported transcript in plaintext. `/export` now redacts the value of secret-named keys (`password`, `token`, `api_key`, `secret`, …) to `[REDACTED]` in both the markdown and YAML formats, while leaving non-secret keys such as `token_count`, usernames, and ports intact.
- **The welcome logo's antenna blinks a fixed number of times on launch, then settles.** Replaces the terminal's indefinite slow-blink with a bounded boot animation — the antenna ball blinks seven times after the banner prints and then holds steady. It is skipped under reduced motion, on non-interactive output, and when the terminal is too short to keep the antenna row on screen.
- **Inline `/command` references get acted on, not just explained away.** When a message mentions a slash command mid-sentence (e.g. "your `/goal` today is to `/plan` and build the page"), the command doesn't auto-run — but the agent no longer leads its reply by reporting it as failed. The per-turn reminder and the system prompt now steer the agent to act on the intent: call the real `EnterPlanMode` tool for `/plan` (clarified as a genuine, callable tool so models stop doubting it exists), pursue the described objective for `/goal`, load `/skill:<name>` via `ReadSkill`, and apply equivalent guidance for other commands — only surfacing how to invoke the literal command when genuinely needed.
- **The "thinking" shimmer no longer runs while a foreground command does.** When the agent started a long-running foreground process — a dev server via `npm`/`docker`, a watch task — the shimmering verb spinner ("Working…/Thinking…") kept animating for the whole turn, implying the agent was busy when it was really just awaiting the subprocess. The spinner is now suppressed while any foreground tool is mid-execution; the tool card's own animated running marker (and its streaming output) carries the liveness, so the shimmer means "the agent is thinking" again and reappears the moment the command returns.

## 0.41.0 (2026-06-11)

- **New `/goal` command — goal-driven execution that loops until verified.** `/goal <objective>` sets a persistent thread goal the agent pursues across turns, restarts, and context compaction until it is verifiably complete. It kicks off immediately with a success-criteria derivation prompt and is re-injected each turn with fidelity rules (no scope-shrinking, no easier-to-test substitutes) and an evidence-based completion audit — completion may only be claimed after every requirement is proven against current state. The new root-only `UpdateGoal` tool marks the goal `complete` (after that audit) or `blocked` (after a strict three-strike audit) and stops the reminders; opt-in `goal.auto_continue` (new config table, default off, `max_continuations` 1–10, capped at 3) drives automatic continuation turns toward the goal until it is marked, a tool call is rejected, or the cap is reached, with a wrap-up instruction on the final continuation. Subcommands: `view`, `pause`, `resume`, `clear`. Objectives are injected as untrusted data, never as higher-priority instructions.
- **New `/best-practices` command (alias `/bp`) and an always-on default profile.** `/best-practices` injects opt-in engineering guidance — code-change discipline, dirty-worktree safety, specific-to-broad testing, todo hygiene, progress cadence, debugging method, subagent orchestration, secrets handling, and verification-before-done — into the session without consuming a turn (`/best-practices <section>` injects a single section). A condensed version of this guidance now ships always-on in the default system prompt — smallest-complete-change ownership, environment detection from artifacts, blast-radius mapping, never-invent-APIs with dependency-name verification, git safety, honest deterministic testing, and a three-failures escalation rule — inherited by the root agent and every subagent role.
- **New `/learn` command — session lesson extraction.** Reviews the session for user corrections, non-obvious error resolutions, and hard-won conventions, distills each into a trigger rule ("when X, do Y"), and persists it to per-project memory (consolidating near-duplicates instead of stacking them). `/learn <focus>` steers extraction; an empty result is explicitly valid.
- **Statusline v2 — a full redesign of the shell footer, plus the new `/statusline` command.** The footer renders colored segments separated by `│`/`·`: a smooth gradient context bar (`ctx 36k/200k ████▌░░░░░ 18%`, green→gold→orange→red by fill, blinking `⚠ CTX LOW` past 90%), a working spinner, live token speed (`in N out M t/s`), session cost (`$1.84`, or `$spent/$budget` once a budget is set), a thinking-effort badge, git `+added/-removed` diff counts, session elapsed time, and a clock. Segments are fail-closed — each renders only when its data source has real data for the active provider/model — so the same default config is correct on Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, and local Ollama/MLX setups. Everything is tunable via `/statusline` (`segments`, `style fancy|plain`, `bar-width`, `budget`, `on|off`, external `command`) and persists under `[tui.statusline]`; ASCII-only terminals degrade glyphs automatically, narrow widths drop low-priority segments, and `/statusline off` reproduces the plain pre-v2 footer. A streaming external `command` can no longer wedge the refresh loop — the runner drains and reaps the child after kill, and renders its first line on timeout instead of failing closed.
- **Parallel subagents and background tasks get distinctive codenames.** Children launched via `RunAgents` whose name merely echoes their type (the common `code-reviewer:code-reviewer` case), or duplicates a sibling's, are assigned a generated `adjective-noun` codename unique within the batch, flowing through the result tree, TaskList, TaskOutput, and completion notifications. Background agent task ids use the same vocabulary (`agent-tidal-wren`) instead of an opaque random suffix, so simultaneous same-type agents are finally distinguishable at a glance.
- **Foreground `RunAgents` batches run concurrently and roll up child findings.** Foreground children now overlap (bounded by `background.max_running_tasks` so a large batch cannot fork-bomb the session) instead of executing one at a time, keep request order, and a crashing child reports its own error entry instead of aborting its siblings. Batch results end with deduplicated `batch_risks:`/`batch_blockers:` blocks that attribute each finding to its reporters.
- **Subagent and todo-list discipline tightened.** Subagent todo lists are normalized to a single `in_progress` item (extras demoted to pending, first wins, order preserved); `SetTodoList` nudges the same single-`in_progress` discipline at the root (with the parallel-batch allowance) and the system prompt gains matching status guidance — no single-step lists, no `pending`→`done` jumps, no batch-completing after the fact. `TaskOutput` steers toward notification-driven waiting and escalates its hint on repeated non-blocking polls; subagents no longer receive plan-mode workflow reminders for tools they don't have.
- **Review pipeline hardened for large diffs and finding fidelity.** The orchestrator decomposes large diffs (one reviewer per subsystem with explicit file lists, deduped on synthesis), adversarially verifies every finding against the cited lines before reporting (non-reproducing findings are dropped, never laundered to a lower severity), re-anchors `path:line` references, and measures review scope against the merge base rather than the uncommitted-only diff. Reviewer specs gain an explicit finding bar, comment-construction rules, and an overall-correctness verdict. Agent specs now tell the truth about their runtime permissions — offline reviewers return third-party claims as structured `needs verification` items rather than asserting them, and `scout`, accidentally defaulted offline, is restored to its network-enabled profile as the designated verifier of those claims. `pythinker review`/`secscan` now surface the previously silent base-ref fallback (`requested_base_ref`/`fallback_reason`) in JSON output, the pretty renderer, and PR-artifact metadata.
- **Workspace jail extended to raw shell commands under restricted profiles.** Read-only/plan/review/verify profiles now apply the file-tool boundary to shell path arguments: discovery/search commands (`find`, `rg`/`grep`, `ls`/`du`/`tree`, `git -C`/`--git-dir`/`--work-tree`) are denied when a path resolves outside the workspace, while file-read commands keep ReadFile parity (absolute outside-workspace reads stay legal, relative `..` escapes are denied). The jail closes the expansion/glob/cwd bypass family — path arguments with unexpanded `$` variables are rejected, glob arguments are validated by their literal prefix, and `cd`/`pushd` moves are tracked across command segments so a later command is judged against the directory the shell will actually be in. Every denial names the offending argument and the workspace root the agent must stay within.
- **Restricted-profile subagents are offline and secret-scrubbed by default.** `PermissionProfile` gains an explicit `allow_network` field: review/verify/read-only profiles deny the network tools (`SearchWeb`/`FetchURL`) at execution time as well as hiding them, with the invariant that a root `yolo` flag never broadens a subagent's hard profile now locked by tests. Their shell subprocesses no longer inherit credential-looking environment variables (`*_API_KEY`, `*_TOKEN`, `*_SECRET*`, `*_PASSWORD`, `AWS_*`, plus bare `PRIVATE_KEY`/`JWT`/`COOKIE`/`BEARER` and their suffixes), and a verbatim command that has already failed twice (whitespace-normalized, so trailing-space padding can't mint a fresh counter) is denied outright with guidance to change approach.
- **Statusline execution knobs are user-scope-only.** `enabled`, `segments`, and `command_timeout_ms` join `command` in the configuration scope locks, so a repo-controlled project config can no longer trigger or observe the user's external status command; `command_timeout_ms` also gains a 60s upper bound. Cosmetic fields (`style`, `bar_width`) stay project-configurable.
- **Base-prompt fidelity improvements.** Inline `/command` references mid-message are flagged once per user message instead of silently reaching the model as plain text; capped file reads name the remaining line count and the exact `line_offset` to resume from, and the prompt requires finishing partial reads of spec/skill/checklist files before implementing against them; user-designated spec files get artifact-scoped authority (requirements to implement faithfully, while embedded directives to run commands or switch tasks stay inert); a Definition-of-Done item walks the task's own checklist, reporting anything unverifiable instead of implying it works; `<system-reminder>` arrival is no longer mistaken for user activity; and approval-mode-aware validation guidance plus a progress-update cadence were added.
- **TUI polish.** No more transient red `<invalid>` flash while tool-call arguments stream (incomplete `None`-valued keys are dropped before rendering); flicker-free streaming on terminals with synchronized output (DEC mode 2026, capability-gated, `PYTHINKER_NO_SYNC_OUTPUT=1` kill switch); slash commands ghost-complete inline with Tab to accept; finished tool-call rows are monotonic (a late or duplicated wire event can't flip a failed row to successful); shell error briefs show the trailing output of a failed command as plain text; and the cursor-position probe can no longer leave the terminal wedged in raw mode on exit.
- **`compact_prompt` config override.** A new optional top-level config key replaces the built-in compaction summarization prompt for both manual and automatic compaction; a `/compact` focus argument is still appended on top, and leaving it unset preserves current behavior.

## 0.40.1 (2026-06-10)

- **Windows/Linux native installers: web UI no longer 404s on `/`.** The installer CI froze the app without building the gitignored web/vis frontend bundles, so `pythinker web` opened a browser onto `GET /?token=… → 404 Not Found`. Both installer workflows now build the bundles before PyInstaller (matching the PyPI release flow — pip/wheel installs were never affected), every PyInstaller spec refuses to freeze when the bundles are missing, and a build that still lacks them serves an explanatory page on `/` (with the REST API still reachable under `/api`) instead of a bare 404.
- **Startup banner renders on legacy Windows consoles.** The `pythinker web` / `pythinker vis` PYTHINKER banner raw-printed Unicode block art, which garbled on legacy code pages (e.g. PowerShell with cp1252) and raised `UnicodeEncodeError` when output was redirected. The banner now honors the existing ASCII-glyph detection (`PYTHINKER_ASCII_UI` / `PYTHINKER_TUI_GLYPHS=ascii` opt-ins included) with width-preserving ASCII fallbacks, and degrades per line instead of crashing when a stream rejects Unicode.

## 0.40.0 (2026-06-10)

- **Web: same-origin WebSockets accepted, version banner synced to the backend, and token bootstrap race fixed.** The local-mode web server now auto-populates the allowed-origin list (an empty allowlist rejects every `Origin`-bearing request, which previously broke all WebSocket handshakes with a 403). The UI version banner prefers the version the running backend reports (via the config API) over the stale build-time constant, and a transient version-fetch failure no longer permanently disables the backend banner for the session. The initial auth-token bootstrap race that could fail the first request is resolved. `ESC` now reliably terminates only the background tasks spawned by the interrupted turn, and recall context is re-framed so prior-session snippets can't be misread as new instructions.
- **Deep-audit remediation: security, correctness, and multi-instance robustness.** Permission gate: awk programs that shell out via `print | "cmd"` / `getline` are now classified as mutating AND destructive (previously only `system(`/`>` and only mutating), and `xargs -L N` no longer hides its payload from classification. Glob resolves symlinks before its workspace-boundary check (an in-workspace symlink could previously list outside content); progress-note titles are ANSI-sanitized like every other transcript field. Grep content lines are parsed with unambiguous field separators, so paths like `utf-8-codec.py` are no longer mangled with `-n=false` and sensitive-file attribution is exact. Multi-line edits on CRLF files work again (LF-joined old strings are CRLF-translated when needed). `/import` preserves paths byte-for-byte (only a standalone leading/trailing `--force` is treated as the flag). Post-compaction file reminders include `--add-dir` files. Double-interrupt can no longer orphan the interruption-marker write (unanswered tool_calls). Background web replay falls back to full history (not empty) when the watermark stat fails, and a malformed Agent resume id returns a clean "Agent not found". OAuth: login fails loud when the token response lacks a `refresh_token`; a refresh response without `expires_in` carries the previous lifetime forward instead of refreshing every tick; the device-id file can no longer be read empty mid-creation. A failed `theme="auto"` background probe can be retried by re-selecting auto via `/theme`. Multi-instance: sessions now take a per-session writer lock (a second `pythinker -r <id>`/web worker on the same session is refused instead of interleaving turns), the shared `pythinker.json` index uses a locked read-modify-write (no more lost work-dir registrations), JSONL appenders repair torn final lines after a crash, forks materialize atomically, project-memory mutations abort on read failure instead of wiping the file, the journal is capped at 100 recaps, inbox approve/reject claims candidates atomically, and recall re-arms when another instance writes new memory. Subagents: a failed summary continuation no longer discards a completed agent's work, hallucinated subagent types fail fast with the valid-type list (before any RunAgents child launches), background failures carry an `Agent ID:` + resume hint, and a crash inside the runner's own error handling is logged instead of silently lost.
- **Breaking (CLI flags): `pythinker web` / `pythinker vis` host short flag is now `-H`.** `-h` is a help alias on both subcommands (matching the root CLI); previously `-h <ip>` bound the host. Scripts using `-h 0.0.0.0` now print help and exit 0 without starting a server — switch to `-H <ip>` or `--host <ip>`. Part of the security/correctness audit (which also confined Grep to the workspace, gated non-HTTPS provider URLs in the web config API to loopback, and stopped saving OpenAI keys on 401/403).
- **Thinking effort moved to a single top-right label on the input border.** The input box border is now one static frame grey at every effort level instead of recoloring the whole bar cold→hot, and the effort is no longer duplicated in the footer line. It's shown once, as a small label flushed to the right of the input's top border — a level-colored dot (slate→blue→teal→amber→orange→red as `off→max`) plus the muted level word — so the dial stays glanceable without tinting the typing area or cluttering the footer. The label is hidden entirely for native-thinking models (`always_thinking`, no user dial) and non-thinking models, and the rule auto-shortens by the label width so the line never wraps.
- **Alibaba login: correct plan-key routing, full live model discovery, and `qwen3.7-plus` default.** Subscription "plan" keys — `sk-sp-`, `sk-tok-`, and `sk-ws-` — now route to the shared international Token Plan endpoint (`token-plan.ap-southeast-1.maas.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1`), fixing a bug where `sk-sp-` keys were sent to the Coding Plan host (`coding-intl`) and every chat then failed with `401 invalid_api_key`. Generic `sk-` keys remain pay-as-you-go Cloud (DashScope) keys. Model discovery no longer filters the live `/models` response down to a hardcoded allowlist — every chat model the endpoint returns now appears (known models keep curated capabilities/context; the rest get sensible defaults), while text-to-image models (Wan, Qwen-Image) are excluded since they can't serve as the agent's LLM. The catalog therefore reflects the key's tier: a Token Plan key surfaces the multi-vendor set (Qwen, DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi, MiniMax), a pay-as-you-go key surfaces that account's Qwen line. The first-login default model is now `qwen3.7-plus` (falling back to the first available model when an endpoint doesn't offer it). The usage panel detects endpoints with no quota API and shows a clear note pointing to the Model Studio console alongside Pythinker's local token tally instead of probing a 404 quota endpoint. The built-in catalog remains the offline fallback when discovery is unavailable. For the Token Plan, whose usage policy forbids automated balance polling and exposes no quota API, `/usage` shows Pythinker's local token tally plus a note pointing to the Model Studio console (My Subscriptions / Usage Analysis) for the Credits balance.
- **Qwen models treated as native-thinking across both plans.** Qwen3.x/3.7 (e.g. `qwen3.7-max`, `qwen3.6-plus`, the Qwen3 Coder models) now carry the `always_thinking` capability on both the Alibaba Model Studio and OpenCode Go plans, matching GLM/MiniMax: reasoning is built in and always on, with no user effort dial and no top-border effort label. Reasoning still flows over the Anthropic `thinking` block that both Anthropic-compatible routes accept.
- **TUI enhancements: adaptive theme, layout, and agent prompt overhaul.** Adaptive terminal-background probe + color-depth blending; reference-CLI layout and palette refinements; unified todo-list renderer; white running-task titles with consistent diff palette; elapsed/tokens/t-s metadata on the background status line; transcript-row bullet fix; renderer guards and markdown fence table unwrapping. All default agent prompts restructured with explicit Mission / Hard Constraints / Workflow / Output Contract sections. Background manager and subagent runner hardened with stale-record reconciliation and resume contract enforcement. Automatic turn recaps disabled by default.

## 0.39.0 (2026-06-09)

- **Refreshed TUI theme and Catppuccin syntax highlighting.** The interface adopts a brand periwinkle/indigo accent (`#B3B9F4` dark / `#0B114E` light) with a reharmonized selection tint, and code blocks now highlight with Catppuccin Mocha (dark) / Latte (light), adaptive to the active theme — implemented as foreground-only Pygments styles with no new dependency. Markdown inline code and links render terminal-native cyan, blockquotes green, and ordered-list markers bright blue (so they adapt per terminal), and user messages sit on a neutral grey block instead of the prior blue tint.
- **Homebrew updater no longer no-ops or false-reports success.** `pythinker update` on a Homebrew install now runs `brew update` to refresh the tap before `brew upgrade`, so a stale local tap clone can't pin the old formula and silently no-op ("0.38.0 already installed"). After upgrading it re-checks the installed version via `brew list --versions` and reports a clear failure instead of "Updated successfully!" when the version did not actually advance.
- **Friendlier usage-limit (429) messages and ChatGPT account switching.** When a provider returns a 429, Pythinker now renders a human-readable notice — the plan name, the reset window, and a dimmed `Server:` detail line (all markup-escaped) — instead of a raw error string. `/login` for ChatGPT now uses `prompt=login`, so you can switch between ChatGPT accounts instead of being silently kept on the previous session.
- **Agent phase-0 enhancements.** Adds a model-invocable cross-session Recall tool (search and read prior sessions on demand, sanitized and read-only for subagents), read-only MCP resources/prompts surfaced as tools, project-scoped `.pythinker/mcp.json` layering, subagent token/cost roll-up to the orchestrator, and truncated tool output that spills to disk with a recovery hint instead of being lost.
- **No more spurious `coroutine … was never awaited` warnings.** Dropped Sentry's `AsyncioIntegration`, whose `create_task` monkeypatch wrapped every coroutine and — when a task was cancelled before its first step during turn/prompt teardown — orphaned the inner coroutine, printing `WireUISide.receive` and prompt_toolkit "never awaited" `RuntimeWarning`s to the console. The integration added no spans (tracing/profiling are off), and exception capture for async tasks is preserved by the existing asyncio exception handler.
- **Read-only profile guard hardened against version-pinned interpreters.** Inline-code interpreter invocations that use a version-suffixed or absolute binary (`python3.14 -c …`, `/usr/bin/python3.12 -c …`, `node20 -e …`) are now classified as mutating/destructive just like the bare `python`/`node` forms, so they can no longer bypass a read-only subagent profile or skip destructive deliberation.
- **The agent sets up and removes MCP servers on request instead of refusing.** Asked to add, remove, or set up an MCP server, the default agent now knows it runs in Pythinker: it configures the server with the `pythinker mcp add`/`remove` CLI (or by editing `~/.pythinker/mcp.json` / `./.pythinker/mcp.json`), verifies with `pythinker mcp list`/`test`, and tells you to restart or `/reload` to load the change — rather than refusing or citing Claude Code/Desktop config paths (`~/.claude.json`) it cannot use. The prompt now also hard-steers the agent away from writing `mcpServers` into `~/.pythinker/config.yaml` (YAML is never parsed for MCP, so such an entry is silently dropped and the server never appears in `/mcp`). As a backstop, MCP config loading now logs a warning when it finds an `mcpServers` block in a `config.yaml` (global or project), so a human or agent that misplaces it gets a diagnosable trace instead of a silent drop.
- **Security: dependency vulnerability remediation.** Cleared the open Dependabot advisories across all manifests. Python: `asyncssh` 2.22.0 → 2.23.0 (path-traversal in `AuthorizedKeysFile %u`) in the `pythinker-host` pin and both lockfiles, and `starlette` 1.0.0 → 1.2.1 (Host-header path poisoning). JS: regenerated the `web`, `vis`, and `install-counter-worker` lockfiles and bumped the worker's `vitest` to `^3.2.6` (critical Vitest UI arbitrary file read/exec), clearing all critical/high/moderate advisories. The only residual is a handful of low-severity transitive `elliptic`/`bn.js` advisories in `web`'s browser crypto polyfill chain, left unforced because the fix downgrades `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` and majors `ai`, breaking the build for marginal benefit.

## 0.38.0 (2026-06-08)

- **Quieter `/login`.** Logging in no longer prints a `RuntimeWarning` about an un-awaited `redraw_in_future` coroutine. The prompt redraw throttle now uses a coroutine-free path (`max_render_postpone_time`), eliminating the warning emitted during the login prompt handoff.
- **Alibaba usage reporting.** `/usage` now ships a dedicated Alibaba adapter, so logging in with an Alibaba key produces a populated cost/quota panel instead of falling through to the no-adapter branch.
- **Live model pricing from models.dev.** Cost estimates in `/usage` and the session stats panel now pull per-model input/output pricing from the models.dev catalog (fetched once and cached for 24 hours), improving cost accuracy across providers.
- **More robust ripgrep resolution.** File search now verifies that a bundled `rg` binary can actually execute on the host platform and architecture before using it, falling back to a system or freshly downloaded ripgrep when the bundled one cannot run — fixing search failures on mismatched-architecture installs.

## 0.37.0 (2026-06-07)

- **Agent runtime tool visibility hardening.** `PythinkerToolset` now filters the tools advertised to the model by active execution policy, permission profile, root/subagent role, and plan-mode state while preserving execution-time guards as defense in depth.
- **Agent design upgrades.** Agent specs now carry mode/hidden/step/model-parameter metadata, built-in `ask` and `debug` primary agents are selectable with `--agent`, the new `scout` subagent handles external docs/API freshness research, and compaction summaries use a stable handoff-oriented structure.
- **Prompt-injection defense: `UntrustedData` wrapper.** All external content returned by `ReadFile` and `FetchURL` is now wrapped in `<untrusted_data id="NONCE">…</untrusted_data>` tags before being passed to the LLM, providing a clear boundary between trusted instructions and untrusted file/web content. The `UntrustedData` primitive escapes embedded closing tags to prevent breakout attacks.
- **Agent boundary artifacts.** New `CodingArtifact` / `VerificationResult` and `VulnerabilityArtifact` / `AuditVerdict` frozen dataclasses in `pythinker_code.utils.artifacts` enforce a typed information barrier between coder and verifier subagents.
- **Recon-first `planner` subagent.** A new read-only `planner` built-in agent type decomposes open-ended tasks into distinct parallel seed descriptions emitted as `<recon_seeds>` JSON, enabling structured fan-out before parallel workers start.
- **Coder artifact contract.** The `coder` subagent now emits a `<coding_artifact>` JSON block at the end of every response, providing structured handoff data (`files_changed`, `test_command`, `expected_behavior`, optional `edge_cases_claimed`) that the `verifier` subagent can consume directly.

## 0.36.0 (2026-06-05)

- **Alibaba DashScope multi-region fallback.** Logging in with a China-region key (`dashscope.aliyuncs.com`) against the default US Virginia endpoint now auto-detects the mismatch and reconfigures for the correct endpoint rather than failing with a misleading "API key is wrong" error.
- **Alibaba Token Plan compatibility (`sk-ws-`).** `/login alibaba` now requires the dedicated workspace Base URL shown in the Token Plan console instead of accepting a public `/models` response as credential validation. Dedicated workspace endpoints hide Kimi K2.6 when Alibaba advertises it without a working route, and use non-streaming Chat Completions for DeepSeek V3.2 because those endpoints return an empty SSE stream. Kimi requests on other Alibaba routes use DashScope's `enable_thinking` parameter.
- **Alibaba model catalog refresh.** Added Qwen3.7 Plus (1M context), Qwen3 Coder Plus, and Qwen3 Coder Flash. Removed `kimi-k2.5`, `glm-5`, and `MiniMax-M2.5` (absent from the live endpoint). Corrected Qwen3.7 Max context window to 1M tokens.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.36.0`, or use the native installer for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Pythoughts-labs/pythinker-code/releases/latest).

## 0.35.0 (2026-06-04)

- **Alibaba DashScope provider and MiniMax M3 catalog.** `/login alibaba` now configures Alibaba Cloud Model Studio / DashScope Token Plan models, including workspace-compatible endpoints and native GLM thinking behavior. MiniMax API-key login now defaults to MiniMax M3 with its larger context and multimodal capabilities.
- **Security review vulnerability intelligence.** `pythinker security-scan` can now parse dependency manifests, query OSV package advisories, look up CVE intelligence from NVD/EPSS/CISA KEV/GitHub/vendor feeds, and carry those leads into security-review prompts and reports as evidence-checked context.

## 0.34.0 (2026-06-03)

### What changed in this release

- **`/stats` usage dashboard.** New slash command opens an interactive prompt_toolkit TUI showing token and cost breakdown by provider/model across Today / This Week / Last Week / All Time. Powered by a static pricing table (`get_cost_usd`) and a session collector that walks `~/.pythinker/sessions/` wire files. `StatusUpdate` wire events now carry optional `model_name` / `provider_key` fields for per-step attribution.
- **Z AI provider auth.** Login/logout via API key, model discovery, and OAuth selector wired into the TUI and `refresh_managed_models`.
- **Moonshot provider auth.** Login/logout via API key, model discovery (Kimi K2.x catalog), OAuth selector wired into the TUI and `refresh_managed_models`.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.34.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.33.0 (2026-06-03)

### What changed in this release

- **Three-scope config resolution (User → Project → Local).** `load_config()` now runs a five-step pipeline — Ingest → Guard → Merge → Env → Validate — merging `~/.pythinker/config.toml`, `.pythinker/config.toml`, and `.pythinker/config.local.toml` with type-based rules. Scalars use last-writer-wins; lists are concatenated (deduplication for `allowed_domains` and `extra_skill_dirs`); dicts are recursively merged. Scope-locked fields (`providers.*`, `services.*`, `feedback.api_key`) are blocked from project/local files with a clear error. The resolved config now tracks which files contributed via `source_scopes`. Local config files are auto-gitignored on first use. PYTHINKER_* environment variables overlay all file-sourced values.
- **Pythinker identity: developed by Pythoughts-labs.** Package metadata, `--version` output, and `pythinker info` now reflect Pythoughts-labs as the author organisation.
- **❓ question marker standardized across all question surfaces.** A new `QUESTION_MARKER` constant in `glyphs.py` replaces the inconsistent mix of `●` (inline transcript) and `?` (interactive panel, pager, prompt) with a single `❓` glyph (ASCII fallback: `?`) used everywhere.
- **Scratchpad isolated to current session; cleans up on interruption.** Agents no longer fast-skim all prior sessions' scratch files on startup, eliminating the post-interrupt confusion where stale planning from previous sessions was injected into a new session's context. Scratch files are now deleted on every session exit — success or interruption — so files no longer accumulate.
- **`SetTodoList` gated behind explicit plan approval.** The tool description and agent system prompt now require that todos are set only after the user agrees on the plan. During planning and exploration the tool must not be called; once set, the list is the single source of truth for execution with status-only updates.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.33.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.32.0 (2026-06-03)

### What changed in this release

- **`pythinker mcp add` no longer crashes on Windows and Linux native builds.** The PyInstaller specs were using `collect_data_files()` which silently omits the `fastmcp-*.dist-info/` sibling directory; fastmcp calls `importlib.metadata.version("fastmcp")` at import time, so every `mcp add` / `mcp list` invocation raised `PackageNotFoundError`. Switched all three specs (Windows installer, Linux installer, macOS/tarball) to `copy_metadata()` — the PyInstaller-standard hook for bundling dist-info.
- **Pythinker work directories are automatically gitignored on startup.** When the agent starts inside a git repository, `.pythinker/`, `.pythinker-review/`, and `.pythinker-review-flow/` are silently appended to the project's `.gitignore` if missing, preventing local agent state from making the working tree dirty.
- **Old sessions and plan files are swept on startup.** Archived session directories under `~/.pythinker/sessions/` and hero-name plan files under `~/.pythinker/plans/` older than `session_retention_days` (default 30) are removed non-interactively at startup. Set `session_retention_days = 0` to disable.
- **Windows upgrade version display fix.** In-place upgrades no longer show a stale version number or re-trigger the update prompt. Inno Setup now wipes `_internal` before installing new files, preventing old `dist-info` directories from accumulating and causing `importlib.metadata` to report the previous version.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.32.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.31.0 (2026-06-02)

### What changed in this release

- **Release promotion no longer stalls when the Homebrew tap is broken.** The `promote-release` workflow now gates only on platform assets and PyPI; a lagging or broken Homebrew tap emits a warning annotation and step summary note but no longer blocks the GitHub Release from reaching Latest.
- **Calmer, theme-aligned TUI rendering.** Transcript, recap, and tool-header output now use theme-standardized activity colors instead of hardcoded values, and Markdown tables render as a bordered grid (wide tables no longer collapse into a stacked-record list).
- **Auto-mode tool approval fails closed when unattended.** In auto/non-interactive runs, an action that still needs approval under the active safe-mode/trust policy is denied with guidance instead of waiting indefinitely for an absent user, and outside-workspace writes are never auto-approved. A destructive auto-approved action is now bounced once for deliberation whenever no user is present (regardless of config), so the obvious `--yolo --auto` combination is no longer more dangerous than the `autonomous_coding` profile; the `auto_deliberate_destructive_actions` setting extends that backstop to interactive `--yolo` sessions, where a user is present but approvals are skipped.
- **Yolo + auto mode hardened against silent over-reach.** Entering plan mode now requires confirmation in an interactive `--yolo` session (matching exit), so the plan-review checkpoint is preserved when a user is present. A `--yolo` run no longer clears or persists the workspace's safe-mode/trust state. A new `--no-yolo` flag forces yolo off for a run — overriding the `--yolo` flag, the `default_yolo` config, and any resumed session state. Resuming a session that restores yolo and/or auto now surfaces a startup warning so it is never silent.
- **`pythinker review` validates finding evidence.** Reviewflow assembles prompts from a shared security-knowledge manifest and validates findings, handling invalid ones without failing the whole review.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.31.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.30.0 (2026-06-02)

### What changed in this release

- **ACP session close and auth errors are spec-compliant.** `session/close` now cancels any
  in-flight work and frees the session's runtime resources (MCP toolset, background refresh)
  before dropping it, instead of leaking them, per the ACP `session/close` requirement. The
  `authenticate` failure path now serializes its `authMethods` to plain dicts so the JSON-RPC
  error response no longer raises `TypeError` on encode.
- **Auto-mode destructive actions deliberate per turn and context.** Auto-deliberation now
  scopes destructive-command one-shots to the active execution context and LLM generation,
  so duplicate destructive calls in one response keep bouncing while later deliberate retries
  and isolated subagent calls are handled independently. If a destructive action is ever
  evaluated without that turn context, the gate now fails closed — it keeps deliberating
  rather than auto-approving the action.
- **Release packaging keeps SDK/core pins in lockstep.** The SDK's `pythinker-core`
  dependency is now updated by release automation and checked by CI/release validation,
  preventing no-sources binary builds from resolving against a stale core pin.
- **Routine dependency bumps with the breaking-change fallout fixed.** Upgrades `agent-client-protocol` to 0.10.1, `aiohttp` to 3.14.0, and `typer` to 0.26.5. Aligns the `pythinker-review` `typer` pin so the uv workspace resolves; migrates the ACP server to the 0.10 auth schema (`TerminalAuthMethod`) and expanded `Agent` protocol (`additional_directories`, `close_session`, session config options); and restores the optional-value behaviour of `--session`/`--resume` (interactive picker when used without an ID) under Typer 0.26's new argument parser.

## 0.29.0 (2026-06-01)

### What changed in this release

- **Reloads pick up MCP and model changes cleanly.** `/reload` now re-reads MCP server configuration added after startup, cleans up stale MCP/model-refresh resources during same-process reloads, and `/model` starts a fresh session when switching models so old context does not carry across providers.
- **Thinking effort controls and safer auto-mode decisions.** Thinking effort is now a first-class setting across the CLI, ACP, web config, and supported providers; Shift+Tab cycles available efforts in the shell, and auto-mode can deliberate with advisor feedback before sensitive or destructive approval flows.
- **Shell sessions get cleaner recaps and rendering.** The interactive shell can show turn recaps, includes hook stdout/stderr in the transcript, improves prompt/file-mention and tool-output spacing, and uses branded browser-login result pages.
- **MiniMax Token Plan model availability stays current.** MiniMax login and startup refresh now use the authenticated model catalog so Token Plan keys only keep models actually available to that key, while preserving user model preferences and isolating discovery failures from other provider refreshes.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.29.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.28.0 (2026-05-31)

### What changed in this release

- **Repository moved to the Pythoughts-labs GitHub org.** All GitHub URLs, install scripts, CI configuration, and the default `/feedback` repository now point to `github.com/Pythoughts-labs/pythinker-code`; existing configs that still reference the previous owner are auto-migrated to the new default.
- **Broadened distribution channels for releases.** Releases now include best-effort Docker/GHCR, Scoop, Nix, and manual WinGet distribution plumbing with channel-native update markers where the installer format supports them.
- **Release preparation now uses a version single source of truth.** `scripts/release.py` rewrites derived release files from `pyproject.toml`, verifies version lockstep on every PR, enforces the frozen `pythinker-review==0.1.0` pin, and managed-channel installs now show channel-native update guidance instead of trying to self-update.
- **Node.js 24 CI with pinned, credential-checked workflows.** CI and release workflows now run on Node.js 24-backed GitHub Actions, pin action revisions to immutable commits, and preflight optional website/tap GitHub App credentials with clear errors or notices instead of opaque token failures.
- **Release pipeline hardening.** Migrate the pythinker-home website-sync dispatch to the org-owned `pythinker-release-bot` GitHub App and fail loud on an empty token; retire the dead pythinker-core API-docs gh-pages publish step; add exponential backoff to the native install scripts and fix the Windows installer's release-pagination cliff.
- **Redesigned startup welcome banner.** The banner now uses a cleaner footer-chip layout: the "What's new / Update available" chip sits on the panel's bottom border, the headline/strapline/help lines align beside the robot logo, and the info grid drops its vertical separator. The robot art and palette are unchanged.
- **Terminal-aware rendering for minimal and CI terminals.** The shell UI adapts to the terminal — ASCII glyph fallbacks for `TERM=dumb` and legacy Windows code pages, reduced-motion mode (`PYTHINKER_REDUCED_MOTION`), and `NO_COLOR`/`CLICOLOR` support that strips color cleanly — so output stays readable in CI logs, SSH panes, and bare terminals.
- **Windows updates avoid encoded PowerShell.** Native updates now launch the signed Inno installer directly with Restart Manager flags instead of a `powershell.exe -EncodedCommand` helper, reducing antivirus command-line heuristic false positives. Windows bootstrap installs use visible `/SILENT` progress instead of fully suppressed setup, and the installer build signs bundled PE files plus Inno's setup/uninstaller/temp copies when signing credentials are configured.
- **New `judge` subagent and redesigned default prompts.** Adds an independent LLM-as-judge quality-gate subagent — a cheap single spot-checking pass for high-stakes deliverables, after deterministic gates — and rewrites the default agent, plan, and system prompts for clearer, more efficient guidance.
- **`.pythinker/AGENTS.md` is no longer loaded as project instructions.** Only `AGENTS.md`/`agents.md` from the project root down to the working directory are merged. Move any instructions kept solely in `.pythinker/AGENTS.md` to a root or directory-level `AGENTS.md` (see breaking changes).
- **Read-only subagent profiles block network and git config-injection shell commands.** The `read_only`/`plan`/`review`/`verify` permission profiles now deny network clients (`curl`/`wget`/`ssh`/`git fetch`) and unsafe `git -c`/`--config-env`/`--exec-path` options that can execute arbitrary commands (for example via `core.pager`/`core.sshCommand`), closing a Shell-tool bypass of a read-only agent's no-web-tools intent.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.28.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.27.0 (2026-05-31)

### What changed in this release

- **`/feedback` submits structured reports with redacted session context.** A new
  `/feedback [bug|feature|ux|wrong] [message]` command collects recent session context
  and strips sensitive file contents before sending, shows a confirmation preview, and
  falls back to opening a prefilled GitHub issue when direct submission is unavailable.
- **Fresh releases surface in the startup update prompt immediately.** The pre-start
  update prompt now revalidates a cached "already current" answer with a bounded
  conditional request instead of waiting for the 24-hour background-check throttle.
  Release promotion also waits for exact native assets, PyPI, and the Homebrew tap
  before marking a version latest, so installed clients no longer resolve a release
  before its install channel is ready.
- **Background agent recovery preserves terminal task state.** Recovery now re-reads
  task runtime under the store update lock before marking orphaned agent work
  recoverable, so a stale snapshot can no longer clobber a task that completed.
- **Project memory recall keeps the simple lexical path.** The unused SQLite FTS
  retriever seam and dead recall path argument are removed; collaborators now use
  a public memory-store root accessor instead of reaching into private methods.
- **Shell prompt echoes and background todo rows are clearer.** Transcript echoes now
  show the resolved submitted text for pasted-content placeholders, and background
  todo rows align continuation icons with the first row.
- **StrReplaceFile now refuses ambiguous single replacements.** A non-`replace_all` edit now
  errors when `old` matches more than once instead of silently editing the first match. Add
  surrounding context to make the old string unique, or pass `replace_all=true` when every
  occurrence should change.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.27.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.26.0 (2026-05-30)

### What changed in this release

- **Install and update no longer 404 on a freshly published release.** The 0.24.0 "atomic latest" gate turned out to be dead code — it ran only on a `release: published` event that a token-created release never fires, and did not affect `/releases/latest` anyway. The GitHub Release is now created as a **prerelease**, and a new `promote-release.yml` runs on the tag push, waits for every platform asset to finish uploading, then clears the prerelease flag and marks the release latest — the single point at which a version becomes resolvable by installers and the in-app updater. As defense-in-depth, the curl and PowerShell installers now resolve the newest release that actually carries their platform asset (skipping drafts and prereleases) and wait for the archive plus checksum before downloading, so `irm | iex` / `curl | bash` run during the publish window no longer fail on a missing `PythinkerSetup-<ver>.exe` or archive.
- **OpenCode Go model catalog refreshes on every startup without a re-login.** Bundled catalog changes — new models, corrected provider shapes — previously reached an existing install only after a manual `pythinker login --opencode-go`. OpenCode Go is now wired into the every-startup `refresh_managed_models` task with its own discovery and a dedicated apply that upserts and prunes across both its OpenAI- and Anthropic-shaped providers while preserving your `default_model` and `default_thinking`. Discovery failures are isolated so they cannot abort other providers' saves; provider `base_url` repairs still require a re-login.
- **Homebrew install shows the logo and fails fast on a missing tap token.** `brew install` now prints the robot-head banner via a formula `caveats` block — the banner previously lived only in the curl and PowerShell installers, which Homebrew never runs. The tap auto-update workflow now detects an empty `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` (lost in the org migration, which had frozen the tap at 0.23.0) and fails with an actionable error instead of an opaque git exit-128.
- **Markdown and report rendering hardened against real model output.** Code-span pipes inside Markdown tables are now protected so a `|` inside backticks no longer fractures the table, and a `report` block nested inside an outer documentation fence is no longer wrongly promoted to a report — report fences are extracted via a markdown-it AST walk instead of a flat regex. Backed by a new TUI markdown/report contract test suite grounded in a real security-scan fixture.
- **Steadier agent editing and a restored update prompt.** File-replace edit handling is hardened, subagent prompt persistence and the agent's working language are preserved across turns, and the todo list stays aligned during a turn. The blocking pre-start update prompt — wired in 0.24.0 but again left unwired by a later refactor — is restored so it runs before every interactive session.
- **CI runs required checks on every pull request.** The `check`, `test`, and `release-validate` contexts were path-filtered off docs-only (and `sdks/`/`examples/`-only) PRs, so the required statuses never reported and those PRs stayed BLOCKED under branch protection with no clean override. The `pull_request` path filter is dropped so every PR runs each required context exactly once; the `push` trigger keeps its filter unchanged.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.26.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.25.0 (2026-05-29)

### What changed in this release

- **`Fetch` now re-checks every redirect hop against the SSRF guard.** Redirects were followed without re-validating the destination, so a public URL could redirect to a link-local address (e.g. a cloud metadata endpoint) and slip past the guard that only inspected the original URL. Redirects are now followed manually and every hop is re-validated, closing the public→link-local bypass.
- **Web domain allowlist for `Fetch` and `Search`.** A new `web.allowed_domains` config option restricts which hosts the web tools may reach. When set, `Fetch` (including every redirect hop) and `Search` reject any host outside the list; leave it unset to keep web access unrestricted.
- **Crash-consistent background tasks.** Task and agent-task state is now serialised under a cross-process per-task lock, so a worker heartbeat landing mid-update is no longer lost. Every terminal agent-task update routes through a single finalizer that writes the authoritative runtime first, and recovery reconciles records left divergent by a crash or kill without ever clobbering a live agent. Bash task output is capped (default 50 MiB) so a chatty task cannot exhaust disk, terminated processes get a SIGTERM→SIGKILL fallback, and aged terminal task directories are pruned (default 7 days).
- **Calmer, more reliable TUI.** The todo list no longer renders twice during an in-flight turn, OAuth and feedback links open through a detached browser launcher so browser output cannot corrupt the terminal or steal key presses, and the terminal is restored to a sane state on `SIGTERM`/`SIGQUIT` and at exit.
- **Live tool-execution feedback.** Tool calls now show a calm "preparing" row during approval and hooks, switch to a live status once execution starts, and stream shell `stdout`/`stderr` as a running tail before the final result lands. The composing assistant block renders a live Markdown preview as the model writes, code blocks gain clearer framing, and the active spinner uses smoother braille dots.
- **Steadier agent loop.** The model is nudged once when a turn ends on a bare statement of intent with no tool call, steered away from blocking on a single background task while siblings are still running, and a `SetTodoList` call whose todos arrive as a JSON-encoded string is now parsed transparently instead of failing validation.
- **Unified report rendering.** Code review, verify, and security-review output now share one standardized, muted report renderer — including `report` blocks emitted by skills and agents; a malformed block falls back to ordinary markdown rather than being swallowed.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.25.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.24.0 (2026-05-28)

### What changed in this release

- **Update prompt is now wired and highlighted.** The blocking 4-choice update menu (Update now / Skip / Dismiss / Exit) was defined but never invoked at shell startup — users only ever saw the passive bottom-bar toast. It now runs before the auto-update path in every interactive session. The persistent status-line update notice also renders in bold bright-yellow so it is harder to miss.
- **Complete native installer `Fetch` fix.** The 0.23.0 release bundled trafilatura's data files but missed `justext`'s stoplists directory, so the `Fetch` tool still crashed with `FileNotFoundError: ./_MEIxxxx/justext/stoplists` on `.exe`, `.deb`, and `.rpm` installs. All three installer specs now bundle both `trafilatura` and `justext` data files. PyPI / `pip install` was unaffected.
- **Atomic "latest" release gating.** The GitHub Release is no longer marked "latest" until every platform asset (4 archives, 1 `.exe`, 4 `.deb`/`.rpm`) is attached. A dispatch workflow polls for completeness before flipping the flag, so `/releases/latest` and the in-app updater no longer serve a partially-built release during the publish window.
- **Smarter `/update` command.** `run_update_prompt` now routes through `do_update(check_only=True)` to get a fresh PyPI version before showing the update modal, and verifies that the expected binary asset for your platform exists on the GitHub Release before initiating a native upgrade.
- **Repository transferred to Pythoughts-labs.** All GitHub URLs, install script references, and CI configuration now point to `github.com/Pythoughts-labs/pythinker-code`.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.24.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.23.0 (2026-05-28)

### What changed in this release

- **Fetch tool works again in native installers.** The PyInstaller-built `pythinker` binaries (Homebrew, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `PythinkerSetup-*.exe`) shipped without `trafilatura/settings.cfg`, so the first `Fetch` call against any non-empty page crashed with `No option 'min_extracted_size' in section: 'DEFAULT'` as trafilatura tried to read an empty `ConfigParser`. The PyInstaller datas tuple now collects trafilatura's data files, so the bundled binary's `Fetch` tool extracts page content as expected. PyPI / `pip` installs were unaffected.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.23.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.22.0 (2026-05-28)

### What changed in this release

- **Reliable update banner.** The auto-update check no longer skips when prompt_toolkit wraps stdout (the incorrect `isatty()` guard is gone), and the 24-hour throttle is now armed only after a successful round-trip — transient first-launch failures no longer silence the banner for a day. The blocking pre-start update prompt is removed; the bottom-bar toast is the sole update UI.
- **Lighter GitHub releases polling.** Update checks send `If-None-Match` with the cached ETag and serve `304 Not Modified` from disk, so shared-NAT users no longer burn unauthenticated rate limit on every launch.
- **Robust Windows upgrade flow.** The detached upgrade helper is launched as a single base64 `-EncodedCommand` PowerShell call, eliminating quote leakage through `cmd.exe`/`CommandLineToArgvW` that had been printing `Wait-Process …` as a literal string. The non-PowerShell installer fallback now sets `close_fds=True` so the running `pythinker.exe` handle is no longer inherited and locked against replacement.
- **Always-clean upgrade staging.** Linux and macOS native upgrades wrap the post-`mkdtemp` work in `try`/`finally` so the staging tmpdir is removed on every exit, including failures (Windows continues to delegate cleanup to the detached helper).

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.22.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.21.0 (2026-05-28)

### What changed in this release

- **Non-blocking memory recall.** Recall I/O is now dispatched to a thread-pool executor, preventing the event loop from stalling during memory lookups. Sessions with large memory stores or slow disks will remain responsive throughout recall.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.21.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.20.0 (2026-05-28)

### What changed in this release

- **Ranked recall injection and Scratchpad working memory.** The memory subsystem gains a dependency-free lexical retriever, ranked recall injection replacing the previous verbatim memory dump, and a new root-only `Scratchpad` tool that lets the agent record structured notes across tool calls during a session.
- **Full memory lifecycle: Phases B–D.** A unified injection bus re-arms recall on every Memory or Scratchpad write (Phase B), session-end episodic recaps are harvested before compaction into a per-project journal (Phase C, off by default), and an approval-gated inbox consolidation flow (`/memory inbox`) proposes—but never auto-applies—memory merges (Phase D).
- **Context-aware and web-fresh agent subagents.** Code-reviewer, security-reviewer, coder, and plan specialists now mandate a context7-first / web-fallback freshness check before scoring third-party findings or writing against a library. The system prompt gains a Granular Todo discipline (one in-progress sub-todo per dispatched subagent) and an Engineering Discipline section.
- **Memory robustness hardening.** Compaction harvest failures are now isolated per-phase (a broken prepare step no longer silently cancels recall), inbox JSON-parse errors log and skip instead of dropping silently, and the recall injection bus uses a knapsack budget that continues filling with lower-priority candidates after a high-priority slot overflows.
- **Animated robot logo in all native installers.** The curl-bash and PowerShell native installers now display a Tetris-style animated robot-head logo on supported terminals, with a static fallback for CI, `NO_COLOR`, dumb-term, or `PYTHINKER_NO_ANIMATION=1`.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.20.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.19.0 (2026-05-27)

### What changed in this release

- **Central per-project agent memory.** Pythinker now keeps a durable per-project memory (`MEMORY.md` / `USER.md`) under `~/.pythinker/projects/<key>/memory/`, written through a new root-only `Memory` tool with content guards and secret-shape detection, recalled into the root agent's first wakeup prompt within a bounded budget, and inspectable with the new `/memory` command.
- **Non-blocking update flow.** The blocking pre-start update prompt is replaced by a cached, no-network startup notice plus a triggerable `/update` command, and the native Windows installer now waits on the launching process before swapping files and cleans up its staged installer.
- **Fully native Homebrew formula.** Brew installs are generated from the same GitHub Release tarballs as the curl installer (including macOS Intel native assets), so they no longer depend on PyPI virtualenv resources.
- **Release pipeline hardening.** TestPyPI publishing is now non-blocking and publish steps carry timeouts, so a transient staging flake no longer fails a release.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.19.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.18.0 (2026-05-27)

### What changed in this release

- **Live subagent activity streaming.** Subagent tool calls now stream live into the transcript, with safe pending headers for in-flight tool calls, new transcript progress events, and a unified shimmer animation across active-work labels so long-running exploration stays legible.
- **Smarter delegation and orchestration.** A Context-First Orchestration Protocol guides the default agent, specialist subagents receive prompt packets for single-objective delegation plus evidence and verification gates, and overflow RunAgents children are deferred instead of hard-failing.
- **Calmer, more resilient TUI.** In-flight and singular Ask payloads no longer flash an invalid badge, MCP startup status is cleaner, and shell rendering and MCP guidance are refined.
- **Sturdier configuration handling.** Incompatible legacy JSON config is now preserved instead of being silently reset to defaults.
- **Security and shell hardening.** The security scan and shell execution paths were hardened against unexpected input.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.18.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.17.0 (2026-05-25)

### What changed in this release

- **Sharper compaction continuity.** PreCompact now carries custom instructions, restores skill and hook context after compaction, triggers SessionStart after restore, and preserves the `Conversation compacted.` handoff so long sessions resume cleanly.
- **Better subagent orchestration.** Subagent specs merge inherited subagent maps, foreground and background launches preserve parent-agent IDs for spawn-tree tracking, RunAgents fingerprints include agent names, and markdown agent discovery warns on unknown models instead of silently falling back.
- **Polished terminal workflow.** The shell adopts the robot-brand palette, compact transcript/agent/file-mention menus, pinned live todo activity, calmer tool output, safer auto-backgrounding for long shell commands, and updated render snapshots.
- **Release and installer hardening.** Interactive sessions show a blocking pre-start update prompt, update exits wait for acknowledgement, Homebrew publish retries package installs, and native installers gain a friendlier animated path with Windows User PATH automation.
- **Provider compatibility refresh.** Anthropic SDK support is updated for 0.101 tool-result block types so direct Anthropic sessions continue to stream tool output correctly.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.17.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.16.0 (2026-05-24)

### What changed in this release

- **Standardized native install docs across platforms.** README Quick Start now presents one canonical Windows command (`irm https://pythinker.com/install.ps1 | iex`) and one canonical macOS/Linux command (`curl -fsSL https://pythinker.com/install.sh | bash`) before package-manager/manual alternatives.
- **Removed old local installer guidance.** User-facing docs no longer advertise legacy local shell wrappers or Python-tool manager shortcuts. `pip install pythinker-code==0.16.0` remains as the universal Python fallback and release-gate snippet.
- **Aligned release artifact instructions.** Manual Windows, Linux package, and tarball sections all point at `0.16.0` GitHub Release assets and keep SHA-256 verification explicit.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.16.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.15.0 (2026-05-24)

### What changed in this release

- **Fixed `pythinker update` for curl-bash native installs.** Frozen onefile installs in `~/.local/bin/pythinker` are now detected as native even when older tarballs do not include the `.pythinker-native` sentinel, avoiding the broken `pythinker -m pip install --upgrade pythinker-code` path.
- **Added Unix native archive updating.** Linux and Apple Silicon macOS native builds now download the matching GitHub Release tarball, verify its `.sha256`, extract `pythinker`, and replace the current executable in place.
- **Improved native update guidance.** The update banner now shows the canonical fixed-version curl installer on Unix and keeps the Windows installer guidance for Windows native builds.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.15.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.14.0 (2026-05-24)

### What changed in this release

- **Install counter and README badge.** `https://pythinker.com/install.sh` and `https://pythinker.com/install.ps1` now route through a Cloudflare Worker-backed counter that records successful installer fetches and exposes both JSON and Shields-compatible badge endpoints. The README now shows the live install badge alongside PyPI downloads.
- **Canonical installer endpoint polish.** The hosted shell endpoint is the documented curl-bash path, the Windows PowerShell endpoint is documented as the native bootstrap, and pinned install examples now target `0.14.0` artifacts.
- **TUI activity and readability refinements.** Tool/agent headers use calmer grey styling, agent task names resolve at call time, live spinner rows stay pinned while status output clips, oversized output is capped, markdown rendering is cleaner, and shell activity indicators are more stable.
- **Release and CI hardening.** Plugin downloads are stricter, pythinker-home sync dispatch now skips when its optional repository-dispatch secret is absent instead of failing the main branch, and release documentation was refreshed for the native installer flow.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.14.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.13.0 (2026-05-22)

### What changed in this release

- **Native installers for macOS and Linux.** `brew install Pythoughts-labs/pythinker/pythinker-code` (Homebrew tap) covers both macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon) and Linux brew installs from a single auto-generated formula. Debian/Ubuntu users get `pythinker-code_x.y.z_<arch>.deb` and Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE users get `pythinker-code-x.y.z.<arch>.rpm`, both attached to every GitHub Release for `x86_64` and `aarch64`. Together with the Windows `PythinkerSetup-x.y.z.exe` shipped in 0.12.0, Pythinker now ships native installers for every supported platform — no Python, Node, or `uv` prerequisite.
- **Cross-OS curl-bash native installer.** `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pythoughts-labs/pythinker-code/main/scripts/install-native.sh | bash` detects your OS + arch, downloads the matching PyInstaller-frozen tarball from the latest Release, verifies its SHA-256, and lands the binary at `~/.local/bin/pythinker`. Supports `linux-x86_64`, `linux-aarch64`, and `macos-arm64`. Honors `--version`, `--prefix`, and `NO_COLOR`.
- **Homebrew tap auto-published on every release.** A new `.github/workflows/homebrew-tap.yml` waits for the PyPI publish to land, runs an in-tree formula generator (replaces the unmaintained `homebrew-pypi-poet` — see release notes for the why), and pushes `Formula/pythinker-code.rb` to the `homebrew-pythinker` tap repo. 132 transitive deps are enumerated automatically — no hand-curation per release.
- **Tag-triggered Linux package pipeline.** A new `.github/workflows/linux-installer.yml` matrix-builds `.deb` and `.rpm` for `x86_64` and `aarch64` (the latter via QEMU on `ubuntu-latest`), then uploads all six artifacts to the GitHub Release via `softprops/action-gh-release@v2`.
- **Frozen-binary data-files fix.** The PyInstaller specs for both the Windows and Linux pipelines now call `collect_data_files(pkg, include_py_files=False)` per package, so `pythinker_code/prompts/*.md`, `agents/default/*.yaml`, `tools/*/description.md`, `skills/*/SKILL.md`, and similar package resources are bundled into `_internal/`. Without this fix the frozen binary crashed the first time it tried to load `init.md` or an agent yaml. The Windows installer that shipped in 0.12.0 is affected; users on that build should upgrade to 0.13.0.
- **Legacy install paths deprecated.** `scripts/install.sh`, `scripts/install.ps1`, `uvx pythinker-code`, `uv tool install pythinker-code`, `pipx install pythinker-code`, and bare `pip install pythinker-code` continue to work for existing automation. The two helper scripts now print a `[DEPRECATED]` banner at startup, pause 3 s, and point at the OS-specific native installer; set `PYTHINKER_INSTALL_QUIET_DEPRECATION=1` to suppress the banner. README Quick Start now leads with the per-OS install table.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.13.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.12.0 (2026-05-22)

### What changed in this release

- **Native Windows installer.** A signed `PythinkerSetup-x.y.z.exe` is now attached to every GitHub Release — install Pythinker on Windows with one download, no Python / Node / uv prerequisite. The wizard installs per-user (no UAC) into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Pythinker`, registers `pythinker` on the user PATH, and broadcasts `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` so new shells pick the change up immediately. Uninstall reverses the PATH edit. Code-signing is wired through `signtool` and ships unsigned until the Authenticode cert lands; from that point forward the same CI job produces signed installers with no code change required.
- **In-app updates for the native build.** `pythinker update` from a native install detects the build (via a `.pythinker-native` sentinel next to `pythinker.exe`), fetches the latest GitHub Release asset, verifies its SHA-256, and re-runs the installer silently (`/VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART`). The `PYTHINKER_CLI_NO_AUTO_UPDATE` opt-out env var that the PyPI path already honors now also gates the native auto-update path — one knob, both flows. The update banner shows a human-readable `PythinkerSetup-x.y.z.exe` line instead of leaking internal markers.
- **Tag-triggered Windows build pipeline.** A new `.github/workflows/windows-installer.yml` runs on every `pythinker-code-v*` tag, freezes `pythinker` via PyInstaller (`--onedir` for faster startup and fewer AV false positives), compiles the Inno Setup script, signs the result if `WINDOWS_CERT_PFX_BASE64` / `WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD` secrets are populated, and uploads the `.exe` plus its `.sha256` to the corresponding Release.
- **Shell terminal rhythm refinements.** Tone tokens, motion timing, and theme palette were retuned (sky-blue `#7dd3fc` / `#93c5fd` accents) so transcript rows, motion status, and dialog surfaces breathe consistently. UI snapshot tests updated to lock the new rhythm in place.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.12.0`, or — on Windows — download `PythinkerSetup-0.12.0.exe` from the Releases page.

## 0.11.0 (2026-05-22)

### What changed in this release

- **Fixed PyPI install conflict (was failing on Windows and every other platform).** `pip install pythinker-code==0.10.0` failed with `fastmcp 3.2.0 depends on mcp<2.0 and >=1.24.0` vs `pythinker-core 1.1.0 depends on mcp<1.17 and >=1`. 0.11.0 pins the republished `pythinker-core 1.1.1`, whose widened `mcp>=1.23,<2` constraint lets the resolver pick a single `mcp` version compatible with `fastmcp==3.2.0`.
- **Blackbox-style TUI port — phase 1.** Shell design primitives, compact transcript activity rows, blackbox-style motion status, standardized shell dialogs, aligned footer status styling, and a restyled tool-result surface land together. The TUI now shares a coherent visual language across rows, dialogs, and motion.
- **Refreshed TUI accent palette.** Dark/light theme accent retuned to a cleaner sky-blue (`#7dd3fc` dark, `#0284c7` light) for better contrast against the new tool-result surfaces.
- **Markdown + report polish.** Report spacing and markdown code blocks render with improved breathing room and consistent fences.
- **Rotating thinking-word indicator restored** with a leading space before the live stream status so the spinner no longer abuts surrounding text.
- **Internal audit + smoke evaluation.** A blackbox TUI scope map, prompt/agent audit, and a recorded visual smoke evaluation join the repo to govern future TUI work.

Upgrade with `pythinker update` or `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.11.0`.

## 0.10.0 (2026-05-22)

### What changed in this release

- **Tool failure recovery improvements.** The agent loop now handles malformed or empty tool-call responses more gracefully and can continue the session instead of leaving the UI stuck after a bad provider turn.
- **Safer file edits.** File write and replace tools now create restore points before mutating files, giving sessions a clearer recovery path after risky changes.
- **Session UX state tracking.** Runtime session state now records additional UX metadata so shell surfaces can provide better continuity across long-running work.
- **Shell command enhancements.** New shell slash-command plumbing improves discoverability and keeps interactive workflows smoother.
- **TUI renderer polish.** Tool cards now share more consistent status glyphs, truncation behavior, and result summaries across bash, read, write, edit, grep, find, web, subagent, background, ask-user, and think renderers.
- **Clipboard handling hardening.** Clipboard helpers now degrade more cleanly when platform clipboard access is unavailable.
- **Release and TUI specs.** The repository now includes the blackbox TUI port design and a visual smoke-test criterion for future terminal UI work.

Upgrade with `pythinker update` or `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.10.0`.

## 0.9.0 (2026-05-21)

### What changed in this release

- **Cleaner TUI — tool card backgrounds removed.** The grey pending/running
  background overlay that appeared behind every tool execution card (subagents,
  bash executions, reads, etc.) has been removed. Only user-message blocks
  retain a background tint, keeping the visual hierarchy focused on your input.
- **Welcome screen enhancements.** The startup info panel now shows the current
  git branch (when inside a git repo) and the session auto-save path alongside
  the working directory and session ID. Branch name is highlighted in magenta
  for quick scanning.
- **Bash header strip styling.** The `$ command` portion of bash execution
  headers now picks up the `tool_pending_bg` token for the strip background,
  matching the reference renderer style and providing consistent visual weight
  across themes.
- **Pythinker markdown renderer wired into message components.** User messages,
  assistant messages, and custom messages now render through `pythinker_markdown`
  (the project's own Markdown renderer) instead of raw `rich.markdown.Markdown`,
  giving consistent heading, code-block, and table styling everywhere.
- **Expanded theme palette.** `theme.py` gains a full `MarkdownColors` /
  `markdown_rich_style` subsystem with dark and light palettes covering headings,
  emphasis, inline code, links, blockquotes, table borders, code-block borders
  and backgrounds, and spinner states (active/done/failed).
- **Improved tool fallback renderers.** The call fallback now emits a
  status-glyph header (`✔`/`✘`/`●`) instead of a bare label. The result
  fallback now truncates long outputs at 60 lines / 4000 chars with an
  italicised note (matching the card renderer's behaviour), and applies the
  correct theme tokens for error vs. muted output.

Upgrade with `pythinker update` or `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.9.0`.

## 0.8.0 (2026-05-21)

Version-scheme reset. `pythinker-code` now ships as `0.8.0` under the new
`0.MINOR.PATCH` line.

### What changed in this release

- **Version line reset.** `pyproject.toml` `version` is `0.8.0` under the new release design.
  All prior `pythinker-code` 1.x/2.x releases have been yanked from PyPI and
  removed from the GitHub Releases page. New installs of
  `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.8.0` resolve to the `0.x` line.
- **Tag scheme standardised** on `v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>`. The
  `release-pythinker-cli.yml` workflow trigger now matches `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+`
  and `scripts/check_version_tag.py` strips the leading `v` before comparing the
  tag to `pyproject.toml`.
- **Release gate preserved.** The `What's New in <version>` section,
  `pythinker-code==<version>` install snippet, and `## <version> (YYYY-MM-DD)`
  CHANGELOG entry are still required for every tag — only the version values
  change.
- **CHANGELOG restart.** Pre-`0.8.0` history archived to
  `docs/history/CHANGELOG-pre-0.8.0.md`; this file starts fresh at `0.8.0`.
- **README "What's New" trimmed.** The cascading 2.x "What's New" wall is
  replaced by a single `0.8.0` section. Past release notes live in the archived
  CHANGELOG and the per-tag GitHub Releases (from `v0.8.0` onward).
- **Test refactor.** `tests/telemetry/test_otel_resource.py` now reads the
  expected service version from `importlib.metadata.version("pythinker-code")`
  instead of a hard-coded string, so future version bumps don't require a test
  edit.

### Included in 0.8.0

All functionality included in `pythinker-code` 0.8.0 is preserved:
review-first workflows (`pythinker review`, `pythinker secscan`,
`pythinker security-scan`, `pythinker debug`), Reviewflow stateful
review/fix workflows, the new `code-reviewer` / `security-reviewer` /
`debugger` subagent roles, hardened review-output validation, and the
read-only PR artifact helpers (`describe`, `improve` / `suggest`, `ask`,
`labels`, `changelog`, `docs`, `compliance`, etc.).

See [`docs/history/CHANGELOG-pre-0.8.0.md`](docs/history/CHANGELOG-pre-0.8.0.md)
for the archived pre-reset release-by-release notes.

Upgrade with `pythinker update` or `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.8.0`.
