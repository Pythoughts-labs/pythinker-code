"""Atomic frame delivery for the interactive prompt renderer.

prompt_toolkit buffers each redraw and emits it in a single ``Output.flush()``.
Without bracketing, the terminal may paint while a frame is still arriving,
which shows as flicker during fast streaming redraws. DEC private mode 2026
("synchronized update") tells supporting terminals (iTerm2 3.5+, Ghostty,
Kitty, WezTerm, Alacritty, VS Code, Windows Terminal) to apply the whole
bracketed write atomically; terminals without the mode ignore the marks.

The patch is installed on the *instance* of the session-shared output, so
every consumer — renderer frames, ``patch_stdout`` scrollback prints, and the
erase/redraw around them — delivers atomically. prompt_toolkit is pinned
(``==3.0.52``); the ``_buffer`` access is guarded so an internals change
degrades to a no-op rather than a crash.
