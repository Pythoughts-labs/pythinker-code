"""Model-keyed protocol-defense injection provider (sysprompt-1).

Some models carry quirks that warrant a short, targeted reminder — e.g.
Qwen-family models drifting into Chinese. Rather than bloating the shared,
cache-stable system prompt for *every* model (or cloning the agent per model),
this provider emits a family-matched defense fragment once per session via the
existing dynamic-injection channel, so only the affected models pay for it.

Scope note: general product behavior (the Pythinker identity override, the
output-language rule) stays in the canonical system prompt — it applies to all
models and is not a per-model quirk. This channel is for *model-specific*
reinforcement only. Wire/protocol quirks (tool-schema serialization, empty
content with tool calls) belong at the provider-adapter layer, not here.
